The speaker acknowledges the inevitable changes to the landscape due to development but also seems to rationalize these changes by suggesting that people will eventually adapt to the new landscape. The mention of the value of preserving natural landscapes and the high tourist value of historical landscapes indicates a concern for the environmental and aesthetic impacts of the project. However, the speaker also discusses procedural aspects, such as the plan procedure and the opportunity for public comment, which could indicate an effort to ensure regulatory compliance and public engagement.

Despite these concerns, the speaker does not explicitly demand additional studies or express opposition to the project's continuation. Instead, they seem to be seeking a balanced understanding of how the project will alter the landscape and how these changes are perceived and valued, suggesting a more measured approach rather than outright opposition.

For these two issues, we checked every complex of the turbines. In terms of viewing, we referred to the residents of the area in terms of viewers. We divided the area into 10 areas, each cluster received a visual analysis on its own. The residents of the mountain stage, the visitors. We checked views from the valley. Each unit received a map of elevations and each turbine received a simulation. For each turbine we have an elevation map and simulation. Each unit received a summary, I brought the interim summary regarding the entire project and our visual inspection says, our summary regarding this whole project says that the visual impact of existing wind turbines are large elements and they are seen and cannot be hidden. However, in the visual inspection due to the location beyond the ridge line and the way they are dispersed, the distance from the settlements and the connection to the infrastructures that already exist on the ridge level, for example the existing turbine farm that is about to be built and the pumped storage, we see a medium visual impact towards the valley, a visual impact that is high towards the settlements, and yet in a way that is not will affect the quality of life of the settlements and perhaps vice versa. This is not a third concept, we check whether or not we see something visual as a negative thing. A visual effect exists, and whether it is positive or negative is a subjective approach. From a subjective point of view, we can determine whether the visual impact causes a negative impact among residents and visitors. The change, as soon as we are partners in the project, we see the change as a change for the better. Anyone sitting here in the room knows that there is a safeguard, that there will not be a single turbine out of safeguarding the environment. Putting a turbine every 200 m is a high and unreasonable visual effect. We check as fixed people the range between zero impact and maximum impact what can be done. For example, if you put a vertical turbine, what is the range of its effect if you put it 200 m here or there. Such turbines cannot be hidden. The criteria is the context of the settlement. We looked, we gave a higher criterion to permanent and non-transient residents. We gave importance to the residents who have to live there all the time, we gave them added value, it is important to us that the residents are the initiators of the program. We checked the visitors who arrive, visitors from both the Gilboa and the Emek, there are the travelers on the road which is also a parameter. We checked the visitors and also the public sites, I have estimates of calculations, I don't have visitors' books, it is possible to add numbers.

Good. So we are initiating together with Kibbutz Meriv a project for wind turbines. This is within the framework of the wind turbine series of the Electricity Authority which encourages electricity production with renewable energy. You are probably familiar with the background, the spirit of things, the government's decisions regarding reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy production. All of this connects with the Electricity Authority series. We operate within this arrangement together with Kibbutz Merav. and in the plan to erect large wind turbines. in the area between -, on the Gilboa in the area between Kibbutz Meriv and Melkishu. You can see the placement plan here. All in all, this is a plan of a maximum of 6 large turbines that are located near the road that leads between Merav and 6 turbines.. Now, each turbine and it appears in the plan documents, each turbine you see this area because a turbine is a column in the end. Each turbine, apart from the facility itself, also has a staging area where they prepare for erection, placing the turbine and the blades on the ground. 80 meters and 125 meters. The height of the column is 80 meters. The height of the blades, the tip of the upper blade from the ground is 125 meters. 3.3 megawatts per hour. In the future there will be technological improvements, - these turbines have a power of, today the models with 3.2 are already talking about turbines in this model that can reach - 3 and a half megawatts. Working turbines, operating in the neighboring kibbutz above Gilboa at a height of 50 meters to a stand with a blade. And we want to pick it up. . Blade tip 65. That's why we asked for a meeting. Meeting scheduled. Next Thursday there is an arranged meeting with representatives who wrote us the letter and with them we will understand the issue. We are not going to fight the Ministry of Defense. We understand their considerations exactly. and their rationale and their position. This is our limitations as entrepreneurs. This is a point of assumption that in my estimation is reasonable, that turbines similar to what is in the neighboring kibbutz can be. So we did submit a plan as you can see, but we are willing to compromise on a path of turbines at a similar height to what will be in the kibbutz. No. The same turbines but smaller. This is a project of 14 units, each (not clear). So we had some technological improvements, let's say that such turbines of a similar height today can achieve 1 megawatt. There are surveys, electricity surveys, we know what the transmission capacity is on the site. we will stick We will go to the program. 70. An order of magnitude of let's say turbines at that height is an economic project - yes. Let's say an order of magnitude of 65 that can be established. Let us update. We want to (not clear) but we live in reality and if the Ministry of Defense accepts us to a certain height, then this will probably be the reality. Now, if we go down to smaller turbines then we will make more turbines. In the meantime we received a positive answer from an electricity company, a total of 12.8 megawatts. This is an existing survey that can be presented and in a parallel process, the electricity company is conducting a larger survey. Scope of 18. But this is one existing survey and it already exists and is in our hands. You can show it on the computer. And another survey is currently being conducted. That's why I told you up to 5 turbines because this turbine is close to above Gilboa. As Malkishua expands we will give up. This is also our story. We just said. We just said. We have also entered into the instructions of our plan, as we understand that Malkishu is expanding and they have an expansion neighborhood and are also familiar with the plan. The turbine will not be in our plan. It is also written in the plans. It is also compatible with having a team that works with the development of the Gilboa and also the local committee when we were there and it was an issue. This is one of the reasons we agreed to him, we understand. We will certainly not create an obstacle for them. In any case, we won't - , we certainly won't cross paths with their plan and we won't interfere with their plan. And we will maintain this distance of 500 meters from houses both from the houses of Kibbutz Merav itself, and from Melkishu and its extension. From our point of view, we know this individual and there is no problem with him. In the meantime we measured on a thin mast at a height of 10 and 15 meters. But what you do at such a stage of a plan, you start by coordinating with the go bodies - the go in general in a proactive way for wind turbines, you have to get to a point where the central ones, with the Ministry of Defense, go through some kind of statutory process, see that the electricity company has a positive feasibility study and see that there is Spirit on the site there. Now, what do we do in terms of wind tests? Crossing theoretical data, that is, taking meteorological data at a variety of stations and producing a predicted energy map and verifying it through wind measurements that are not parallel. At this point we are not building yet. This is a plan in itself or a permit in itself, a measuring station at a height of 85 meters that is usually done by international consulting companies as part of the preparations already for financial closure. It is also about significant costs. At what stage do we bring the program? We have already coordinated it once with an electricity company and we saw that there is a feasibility study for the release of the energy. For the second time we are starting the statutory procedure and here we are with you today to receive instructions for reviews. A third time coordination with the Ministry of Defense and a fourth time the same specific wind measurement of extrapolations show that an energy map is suitable for this type of project and is before the minister and given that all these conditions will come together then of course we will continue with more significant moves including a parallel wind measurement that will eventually lead to the realization of the plan",1,1,1,1,1,Support,1,"The statement reflects a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project.

Today, in the areas where we want to build the turbines, field crops are grown. The kibbutz belongs to the Lower Galilee Regional Council. The kibbutz is 10 minutes from Tiberias, In 2014, recommendations were published and approved by the National Planning and Construction Council. The team included representatives from all the relevant entities in the field. It also recommended the Lavi complex. The area of ​​our project is actually smaller than the recommended area. Of course, I will present it to you shortly 7 turbines with a power of up to 21 megawatts. The power of each turbine is about 3 megawatts. The wind on the site should allow us to produce about 50 million kilowatt hours. which will actually allow the consumption of electricity for 7500 households. The facility will not be connected to high voltage, it will be connected to the distribution network with high voltage lines. And its edge height is up to 180 meters. When you can see here the typical dimensions of the turbines, a mast height of 120 meters and a length of about 60 meters. When the diameter of the mast is about 4 meters. In 2013 we received a charge applicability survey from the international consulting company Gerard Hassan. Basically a report that helped us understand the potential to produce energy on the site. In 2014, as I mentioned before, the inter-ministerial team recommended Levi and that year we also started measuring wind on the site. In 2015, we received positive feasibility studies for electricity extraction, from the electricity company, and accordingly we also submitted an application to the Electricity Authority for a conditional license. And on February 21 of this year, the plan was recommended for submission by the Lower Galilee local committee. You can see the main points of the recommendation here. They sign up to deposit under the following conditions - approval from the Israel Lands Administrator, submission of a letter of indemnity, RTG approval and of course a commitment to dismantle the turbines at the end of their life. Here you can see the blue line. This is actually the agricultural area of ​​Kibbutz Lavi. To the south of this project is the kibbutz itself and the existing areas You can also see the entrance to the facility, which is actually connected to the existing road. This is the recommended layout for the 7 turbines. And they are all in the area recommended by the team. We have more infrastructure We have limitations. First of all, there is a 161 kV overhead line, it exists today north of the kibbutz. There is also an approved route for a 400 kV overhead line that is planned in accordance with TMA / 10 / C / 6. It is north of our project. Because of the directives of the electric company that we will maintain a security strip between the lines and the turbines, so this actually puts us somewhere in the middle between the two lines. You can see it here. Because we have to maintain a safety zone of several hundred meters. Some basic planning of the project. So each turbine has a cast gravity element. No. I will show you the 3 connections shortly. You can see it in the construction appendix. You don't see the network itself here, really. so sorry There is a cast gravity foundation. It basically forms the base of the turbine, it's 20 by 20 meters in size. and a main surface for a main crane measuring 40 by 40 meters. As you asked, so actually the actual expenditure of the electricity is done by up to 3 high voltage distribution lines. When there will be no overhead power lines and there will be no connection to the Tahmash. There is no need to establish a Tahmash. In each such connection when we said there are up to 3, then in each high voltage connection there is a collection network which is a hidden line that collects the electricity produced by the turbines and connects them, and is the one that takes the electricity to the switching room. Each high voltage connection has one switching room of approximately 50 square meters in size and due to the limitation of feasibility studies to deal with voltage control, there is an option for an additional room or a container of approximately 30 square meters in size. And during the entire period of activity we will place a measuring mast at a height of about 80 meters. You can see here some visualization of the things I said. of the landscape area of ​​40 x 40 and a turbine base that is 20 x 20 meters in size. And the branding room will reach up to 80 square meters. So during the construction phase we are of course planning to make use of existing roads as much as possible to allow the continuation of agricultural activity. The turbine itself comes in parts from the factory, the assembly itself is done on site with the help of cranes on top of the cast base. Cranes with a lifting capacity of 500 tons and 250 tons. All the infrastructure work, foundation, construction and so on, all this is done in a period of six months to a year. But the assembly of the turbine itself, after having the cast foundation, takes place - in total - for about 3 days. There is some kind of visualization of the construction process here. First, the cast foundation of the turbine is excavated. Then the foundations themselves are built. Here we can see the construction of the turbine base under the ground. When we finally see on the surface of the ground only the screw on which the turbine column is dressed, which is only 4 meters in diameter. Here you can actually see what it looks like above ground in the same city. in our projects abroad. And this is the basic structure of the construction surface. So we said 40 x 40 when we have it on the side. Do you see the mouse here? No? You can see here on the side the turbine base, the blades and the access road. The plan documents, so it's actually some kind of sheet of a fairly standard proposed situation for wind turbines that we are talking about agricultural land and engineering facilities, so as I said, we have all the recommendations of the international team, and according to the tests we really did of the wind in the area, and of course, this is actually some kind of request from us that you will allow We still have the flexibility. Of course, we are reducing the area by 600 dunams, which will of course be reduced after we specify the roads and the layout of the turbines , and against the predictions fine tuning - yes. For now it is. We still do our e to the spirit. But basically. That's exactly why we need the flexibility space so that we can continue to refine it within the same search range. But of course you will approve at a later stage a plan much - much more limited than that. There is no further. Next is thanks and thanks for receiving - , unless you add something else.

It's really a subject of objections. It is a topic that is not in the environmental impact review. What I am proposing, Uri, is that I - , the problem is that as if we are sending him to the stage of the objections it is true that this issue needs to be discussed there, but on the other hand, that he comes to the objections, but he is already at a disadvantage.

The committee considered the issue of the pills, it considers that the issue should be discussed during the objections phase.

We also understand that there is a need for a plan that will allow flexibility, because life has a game in it. But the question is - , the question is about - , how much and what flexibility, at which intersections, and who is the one who allows these flexibilities now, when the issue of turbine height, we have all been burned by the issue of Gilboa and Sirin. Since the plan specified the height of the turbines, to change it, the plan had to be changed. Everyone was scared, and we didn't want to go to that, and went to some - , they stayed on this issue none of the height set by the plan, even though it has been many, many years. Almost over 10 years until this story came to fruition in one way or another. But for example, the plan here in Geva talks about 10 percent, this in my account is 200 meters.

I think that - just the suggestion that was here in the instructions of the program, it is entertained in the spirit here. So maybe this is a place where we need to be more specific about which documents are required for this story. And what will happen with the state of flexibility in this matter. For example, the topic of organizing areas is definitely something that brings us to the stage of a building permit, because then things become clearer.

We want to move forward and discuss and make this decision a possibility. Consideration should be given to the issue of distances from water reservoirs.
Because it is a source of water and a source of food. Therefore, according to international documents, distances from water reservoirs are determined there. Now, the reference is to water reservoirs, although larger or (unclear) in some, but factually in this area we have several turbines that are close to water reservoirs, which is less than 200 meters, which is the distance required according to international documents. We demanded in the instructions of the plan, or recommended that the district committee consider moving the turbines to distances not less than 200 meters to the reservoir. Now, the issue here is that the reservoirs remain under the authority of the fasting association and not under the authority of the developer who operates the turbines. who owns the turbines. That's why he doesn't have the ability or needs to see how he can influence if, for example, he decides that this reservoir is bothering him and he wants to cancel it, close it, empty it.

This is how they can be treated. This is also something that came up in the discussion here. I think there was some kind of agreement about him. The land designation remains proposed agricultural areas and engineering facilities. Access is based on existing roads and agricultural roads. It is about the expansion of some of them and restoration. Issues of noise and vibration are said to meet the standard. The minimum distance from settlements is 1300 meters and this fits quite well with the district's policy regarding distances from settlements and the possibility of development. The subject of unifying the infrastructures came up, because it is the same space, why should there be 3 organizing sites, 3 ways of access. The developer said that if one program progresses at a different pace than others, due to planning or other considerations, we recognize that there are also limitations from the Ministry of Defense, etc. So he wants to keep to himself the option of moving forward with one plan and not depending on other plans, in terms of the organizing areas and ways of access. If there is an agreement that as the plans progress together then they will also be established together. It is also in the entrepreneur's interest to save himself unnecessary expenses.

 4 years. You - we entered the eagles at random. there's nothing to do. Populations like random events. For example poisoning 1 to 3
 taking the day - day by day. So you can't take one year that could also have a random event. It's general about it's general about
 demography. We chose to start with a demographic model of pelicans. I didn't know I would have to do it here, neither do we
 As part of the discussions on threshold values, we prepared demographic models for different populations. including pelicans. transition
 Because the pelican, unlike most migratory birds in Israel, is almost the only one found in one of the strictest annexes of
 Migratory Species Convention. Its population is not its owner. Armageddon in South Africa maybe its owner. We ran a demographic model
 That Gau Teva presented an apology for the harsh expression is fundamentally unfounded. They inserted, for example, an annual reproductive value from a Mishnot article
 The 60th of Agam in Ethiopia of 1.88 offspring per couple but in the European population of the Land of Israel model according to
 Relatively recent doctoral theses, Balkan, their reproduction is less than one chick per pair per year. or 0.65. You understand that
 times 3? So the whole model looks different. According to the literature, the breeding age of a pelican can be either 3 or up to 8 years of age
 reproduction According to you can put in model 3, you get look, it's different values. Low reproduction age of entry into reproduction is different.
 We ran the model. The population according to 250 turbines designed in Israel, or the expectation according to 740 megawatts - population
 Pelicans migrating in Israel whether or not we comply with the treaty that stipulates 0 harm to pelicans, one of the only species. they say
 that we can damage Israel by 0.9 pelicans per turbine per year, we will reach 1. world population in decline. we ran
 This model according to all the parameters of high reproduction low reproduction. And according to what we - , and here the data is relevant, no
 From an article of 3 years of observations on a lake in Ethiopia but populations that come to Israel, because we in Israel broadcast
 And we captured 240 pelicans. Some of them are broadcast and some of them even we know where they come from we know where they are
 nomadic So I'm sorry that a model is presented here that is demographically and factually based on incorrect data. This is the discussion of threshold values
 But I want to talk about the story of the farm in Sirin and the proposed farm. The first thing is the injury, another general statement
 I won't go into bats but the statement that damage to Sirin is minimal so to speak, we are required to report on Art.
 that we are signed, we submit reports every few years, including injury reports, we submitted to Euro B on bats found
 Die in Sirin and Gilboa. All the experts who are represented in the Euro B Convention which is under the Migratory Species Convention is a European agreement
 that Israel is a member of, claim that it is high values ​​on a global scale. the amount of bats. I just want to explain the ear
 Not related at all, now RTG is holding an event in Ramat Sirin because of this event for a month, 6 phones have already been found
 Before fringe monitoring of twice a week with a dog. There is no such thing as this on a global scale. Guys we are way above
 the average Also in the model we did to fix the poor monitoring that was in Sirin Gilboa and as a result we turned to Afcon companies before
 that the Naberanis erupted and we informed them that we demand to continue the monitoring because what is being done is not acceptable. We have started regular monitoring
 You see an injury there. Minimum damage value for poultry as well, we reached a value there that is above the global average. According to the same article
 of Reidel, the same psychologist who did amazing work all over the world covering 100 or so data farms from turbine farms.
 The damage to birds and bats in Israel is above the global average due to poor monitoring. What we don't know from this monitoring is
 who was hurt But we'll talk about that later. But the demographic nativity of pelicans makes me sad to say that I can't trust models
 Other demographics presented here so it is done to take trend data. Even in saying species that are not harmed it is trending because
 There are models or studies that show that there are species that may benefit. Wolves for example in the peninsula (not clear) stopped
 Walking around the turbines maybe it's because I walk around there. about bears You can cite studies from all directions.

 Sirin has -
 You will understand, how many are likely to be affected every year. I present here in a table what is actually found, in those sample partial scans
 contingency. There are times when the farmer also found what the scanner did not find. A farmer sent us a photo of a stork lying underneath
 for turbines. We know that many carcasses in Ramat Sirin were evacuated from the area. Not to hide evidence, it wasn't pleasant for those
 who work in the field to work, step on carcasses. So the workers there told us when we started investigating the matter that they were also missing
 carcasses But this is what is actually found without any correction. So a common falcon? For example, the model estimated 0. but 3 were injured per year

I think the biggest responsibility is yours. Be precise and refine the information. Yes, documents were submitted to you including cumulative effect, unfortunately we did not receive a reference. At the end of the day, there are two issues here that I see as coming up that by the way were discussed in a previous discussion, one is winged animals, the second is the sacrifice to a nature reserve. OK? As far as wingmen are concerned, Gil said he said it distractedly without meaning to but at the end of the day there is better monitoring better less. A sympathetic speaker I think in the context of Sirin said the monitoring was fine. The reports were less good.

You want once a month will be once a month. We are committed to the program's instructions.

 of the Naberani outbreak, last Friday Degania plowed the field of asbestos and stopped the turbines, in order to
 stop the nabbers. I mean, they didn't copy the crop, they didn't even plow the field. But there is such a thing inside a reserve

 Yes. We would really like that. Anyway, we did this analysis, we saw that populations can only be harmed by cereals,
 and Sirin Farm. That is why we are analyzing whether damage from this number of turbines can harm bat populations
 these? We found no. So we can say that a spatial analysis showed that bat populations are affected by the Dagania program
 are not at risk of extinction at all. They are able to compensate for loss due to damage from wind turbines if any. and there is

The addition of wind energy will save on conventional facilities. Wind energy not extra space. Allows dual use of the land. Both agriculture and electricity generation. To illustrate, one wind turbine today produces as much electricity as a solar installation of 80 dunams of land. It's quite a bit. No water is used. And the thing that most characterizes the North District here is that most of the wind plans, most of the projects are promoted in the North District. Most of the solar projects are promoted in the South District. This thing actually allows energy decentralization. Creating an additional source of production in the north. Savings in the electricity network. to transfer electricity from the south to the north. The last position of the Electricity Authority is what I said, I conclude. This is a letter from the chairman of the Electricity Authority to all the district committees. Looking ahead, also given the existence of large-scale solar facilities. Perhaps this is also why it is so important to integrate wind energy into the renewable energy mix of the electricity sector. Thank you. tall?  
Another word about the threshold values. We, in the Spirit of Genesis, reached an agreement with RTG that contained a definition of what the threshold value is. I will read it now. Threshold value - the maximum number of individuals for each species of winged bird that, if they are harmed in a year as part of -, as part of the operation of the turbines, no significant harm will be caused to the population Winged birds of the same species.
What Hillel said is not true, that the average speed is 8 meters per second on economics. Because also the regulation of the Electricity Authority
that the state did, talks about an average wind speed of 6 to 6.3 meters per second. This is the calculation in the rate, this is the calculation
The energetic therefore it is true that it is 8 meters per second is 6 meters per second.",1,0,1,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They emphasize the benefits of integrating wind energy with solar energy, highlighting the advantages such as electricity production during non-sunny periods, saving on conventional energy facilities, and allowing dual land use for agriculture and electricity generation. The speaker also mentions coordination with regulatory bodies and adherence to approved guidelines, such as the agreement with RTG on threshold values for avian impact, which indicates a commitment to minimizing environmental impacts within accepted limits. Furthermore, the speaker corrects misinformation about wind speeds, suggesting a focus on factual and regulatory accuracy.

21/01/2019,255-0220814,ועדת תכנון מחוז צפון,Developers,"I will present the project, the plan, the components of the project and the requirement for an environmental impact review and the important parameters. In terms of the project, this is a project that we have been promoting since 2014 in planning committees and also in front of the Electricity Authority and the Electricity Company. Prior to that, preliminary work was done to sign the agreements with landowners in the area. Residents of Kfar Kasra Samie. The conditional license power of the project is 19.8 megawatts. It is about 5 wind turbines. An infrastructural investment of 200 million NIS, power lines, turbines, in the area, and access roads to the turbines are today existing agricultural roads. Most of them are road sections that are used by local farmers, and we will improve the infrastructure and access to agricultural plots. The electricity generation capacity of the project is over 50 million kutch About 9 thousand households. When we are talking about a turbine that will probably reach around 200 meters, this project can supply approximately 3 thousand residents in the area. Khulus, Harsh, Lapidum, Yanoh and Kfar Vardim. We started the project like this, so it is about 6 years of developing 5 wind turbines. We started the project with 11 turbines in the layout The original one. Two wind turbines were disqualified due to the proximity to an overhead power line. 3 turbines were disqualified due to a request and agreement with the local council, for the purpose of maintaining the village's future development, according to its request from the program due to an agreement with the Zodiac company after the request of the North District Committee. In the end we are left with 5 turbines. 50 percent of the original plan. At the end of this program, it will produce more energy than 22 turbines erected in Sirin and Gilboa are working these days. The project plan and environmental impact review. In the end the project has very clear components. It is connected to the national electricity grid through hidden distribution lines that will reach the Methashim program of the electric company in the region. The distribution lines will be connected to an electricity connection point and will eventually connect clusters of turbines between 2 to . This project was approved by the inter-ministerial team. is in the field, a variety of entities in Israel participated in this team. The Ministry of Energy, the Electric Company, RTG, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the green area, emphasizes that in the end it was recommended for promotion by the inter-ministerial team. Also in the draft policy document of the district committee, the North is in a green area allowed for development. OK. At the end of land designations in accordance with - TMA / 35 The program is in an integrated preserved texture. In terms of TMA / 2 of the North District Committee, all the turbines are for agricultural purposes. Apart from the adjustment, they are all privately owned in the areas most of them are cultivated these days and violated. , an ecological corridor is located north - , south of the turbine. The turbines are designed on degraded agricultural land. The whole area there is also under development. And the land grab turbines the land in the end is very marginal. Here are - , here is the ecological corridor. At the end of the turbine above the ground, a very limited area with a diameter of 4 meters is added, which definitely allows the agricultural use there of already cultivated land, which is violated, and it will not affect an ecological corridor except for the construction works of the project. Map of limitations and attitude to the Zodiac plan We, in accordance with the decision at the request of the committee, removed Turbine 7 from the project and also signed an agreement with the Zodiac company according to which guidelines will be included in the plan that construction restrictions for other wind turbines in the area will not apply. 0232264 - to the plan of the Zodiac company. Plan 258 Distances of turbines from a blue line of settlements I refer to the blue line on plans that are in process, plans that have been deposited and plans that have been approved. In the end Rob approached Turbine 11 which is 615 meters from the future development of Kasra on the basis of plans again, which I discussed plans in promotion and approved plans. 813 meters from Mount Halutz and the rest of the project is over a thousand meters away from the other settlements in the area. You can see it here on the slide. A blue line of settlements and TPMS. In the end, on the basis of TPMS spots, what we notice about Turbine 11 is that there is an area designated for industry in the Har Halutz plan, also included in the TPMS of the district committee, and this area is also painted purple on - Test basis and all the information that exists on the network or on the basis of the planning information, also as SRA again, we examined plans of all the plans that are promoted today also regarding spots and we are the smallest distance in terms of sensitive uses settlements, houses, in the end it is about 615 meters. Regarding the issue of noise and vibration. In the end, the whole issue of wind turbines in relation to public health concerns comes from 3 basic things. The issue of noise and vibration, and the so-called infrasound. In the State of Israel, both the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health, after several years of examination, issued clear instructions regarding the whole issue in terms of wind turbines. A hazard or a nuisance to the public. Between 500 meters and a thousand residential meters, a noise and vibration assessment will be performed. Above a thousand residential meters there are no restrictions for building. Exact guidelines have been established here regarding the subject of background noise 45 outside houses and residential noise DB 40 in accordance with the regulations to prevent contact with noise, loud noise and the whole issue inside the houses from existing background noise. A consolidated standard is given here, an infra sound standard, I think the strictest in the world, there is no DBA 5 - no more powerful than just explaining infra sound surrounds us, we live around. DBG 75 countries in the world that requested an infra sound standard for infra sound, everything produces infra sound, including air conditioners, refrigerators, the sea produces Infra Sound. We live in an infrasound environment, which is actually sub-noise, what everyone calls it. The Ministry of Health also formulated a stricter standard that comes to 30, which is no more than 30 hours / ostensibly to protect the public. International standards have also been issued regarding jitters of 30 per year and 30 minutes per day. I will soon show you that in terms of all these parameters, this program stands above and beyond. In terms of background noise and projected noise heard outside the buildings. We checked the nearby settlements because over a thousand meters what DBA 35.3 really has no effect on this project is very far from settlements. From the Lapidot station, the existing background noise is DBA 40 - which exists today and the predicted cumulative noise from all the turbines is 34.8. From Kisra, background noise exists today between 38.4 and the noise produced by all the turbines is 38.6. At the pressure mountain the existing background noise today is 35.1 and all the turbines will produce 35.8 of the existing background noise. We are very - DB 5 so we are not - , we are well below the threshold and do not rise above DBA. Very far from it. Even in terms of noise heard inside the buildings, it will be significantly below the standard. In Lapidot 28.8 Kasra Bin is again far below the hazard prevention standard. Also regarding infra. DBA .30.8 in Har Halutz DBA 3.6, 36 - 29__ Sound According to the position of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health, as soon as you comply with the noise regulations, noise is heard, you will also comply with the issue of infra sound. Therefore this project shows once again that we are a normal A, a decibel on the scale far below the standard of the noise heard. Therefore, there will be no problem regarding infra sound either. And also the committee, in accordance with its decision, can, as it does with most wind plans, install a provision in the plan regarding infrasound values ​​that will not exceed 75 regarding vibration - no vibration disturbance is expected towards sensitive uses. Again, also in accordance with the position of the Ministry of G. Decibel on the health scale, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, that over distances of more than 500 meters from sensitive uses no vibration nuisance is created. Jitter can be accurately predicted physically and can be completely controlled through technological means. The instructions of the program also established 30 what I was talking about, as soon as you stand there is no disturbance / that international standards are met, the same standards of 30 tremors. At the same time, we made a theoretical vibration model that shows that in an extreme theoretical situation I'm talking about an extreme situation, this means the turbines are working all the time, there are no clouds and the topography does not block vibration. Therefore in the end, even in these models we reach an extreme case where the turbines work all the time with torches for 19 hours. In a realistic theoretical model where clouds are assumed and the actual work of the turbines is assumed because turbines only work 80 percent of the time and not 100 percent of the time. We reach 9 hours in torches, in a year that is again in a theoretical state, so no vibration disturbance is expected towards sensitive uses from this project. In the end, you can look at the position of the Ministry of Health and also the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Dr. Aviad Adar, what he says is that in the end, residents of Israel can sleep safely at least from this aspect of low frequency noise. The distances in these recommendations mean that they will not be exposed to any harmful form of low-frequency noise and the Ministry of Health was also told in 2017 that most of the claims and implications of wind turbines are not yet scientifically based. And regarding the low-frequency noise threshold, a strict standard has been set in Israel. Also regarding again what I said before regarding the subject of background noise and infrasound. As soon as you stand in background noise, you also stand in infrasound. Regarding ways of access to the project, all the ways of access to the project are mostly roads and also connecting to statutory ways in the project are only for the purpose of establishing the project. In the end, the total roads are talking about temporary roads and principle roads, I'm talking about 5200 meters. that during the operating period we will only need 3 thousand meters of it. of ways. Usually the maintenance of the turbines is an infrequent maintenance, carried out by 4 x 4 vehicles. Breakdowns in wind turbines The serious breakdowns hardly ever happen. If this really happens, very rarely, that's why this program is based on roads, most of which will eventually be used to transport the turbines into the site, after which they will be restored and what will remain are agricultural roads based on existing agricultural roads and preventive maintenance of the turbines. Regarding the issue of turbines and road sections, and slopes, which in the end the project is mostly planned on existing dirt roads that are used by farmers. A large part is road plots. The roads will be connected to 5 meters, they will also improve the ability of the farmers to cultivate their land and another 1 meter for drainage. All roads and temporary extensions during the construction period only, at the end of which restoration will be carried out in accordance with the environmental landscape annex attached to the environmental impact review, and will return the strip to its function as an agricultural area. And we will do according to the recommendations of the landscape consultant, we will use a lot of the landscape of the existing terraces. Also roads to construction surfaces for the purpose of supporting his journey and also to the construction surfaces of the project. The area with the most slopes in this project is the area of ​​turbines 3 and 4. In the end, the gap, the design and all the landscape planning and all the planning of the project was carried out on the basis of the existing terraces, therefore the maximum support as you can see will be 4 meters to produce some which is uniform with the landscape of the existing terraces in the area both in terms of construction areas and in terms of access ways to the turbines. In terms of a map, turbines are seen again, we do not deny that they are visible in the landscape. They are quite noticeable especially at 200 meters. This is ultimately a subjective approach. There are those who think it is not beautiful, there are those who think it is very beautiful. We made an environmental landscape report for this project. This is the observation map. Most of the main significant observation basin will be 2 and a half km from the turbines. I'm not saying that they won't see it from other places, but they will, but you can see that, for example, the Kfar Veradim area will hardly see the turbines, in many areas far from the project they won't see the The turbines. But in the area it will be very noticeable. We have done simulations for the project. Many people think that the simulations that are carried out by the way, we also do simulations from videos of turbines. Spirit people think it's not real. It is very difficult to simulate turbines, but a work was done here that shows the simulations from several points of view. This is a simulation from Nahal Kishor. We have also shown extreme scenarios in which the Ministry of Defense or the Civil Aviation Authority will require us to paint all the turbines in orange and white colors, which does not sound reasonable because, based on our experience in other projects, usually most turbines are painted aviation white, and only the extreme turbines in the project are painted, and I am talking about Stand alone in orange and white colors. So at the request of the Ministry of Environmental Protection we presented simulations with all the turbines painted in orange and white. Visualization from Deir al-Assad you don't see the turbines from there. Pioneer imaging. It should be noted that Turbine 7 is not in the project, we took it down in accordance with the agreement with Zodiac, but it is here in the simulations because each time you access the editing of new simulations. There is no need for it. Because the situation will only improve from the point of view of Turbine 7. This is a view from an access road to insult. An access map to Mount Halutz is the first one already in Kasra itself. towards the west. This is from road 854 from the Tefen area. It is from a resting area from the southeast. This is from Mr. Tamir Chazot: Again, the scenic effect of the farm in relation to other projects that are being promoted here is not a main effect. The main observation basin will be at a distance of 2 and a half km. We are really in the planning, also in the landscape planning we tried to have all construction areas on the roads integrated on the basis of an existing terraced landscape. Landscape treatment in this project will be directed there. We carried out a number of public participations in the project. We chose public participation From our point of view, it seems more correct to present the project to the residents in April 2016, which we published in the newspapers, and in all the notice boards in the area. After that, we met with the Kfar Vardim regional council and representatives from the 2000 - In August 2017, we also met with the Meshgav Regional Council and presented the project in terms of public participation. We conducted a comprehensive survey of winged animals in accordance with the instructions and instructions we received from Geo Teva and Doc Eyal Shochat An expert in the field. In the end, the process of carrying out a survey was carried out in accordance with the environmental protection. A dedicated radar was used to carry out the survey. Surveys were carried out during migration seasons and a bat survey was carried out. through the appropriate means. A comprehensive analysis was carried out for the report prepared on the subject and also a statistical model was compiled regarding risk assessment for winged animals. At the end of the bottom row, 67 winged birds were identified in two migration seasons. Statistical additions were made to it in accordance with the requirement of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. A risk model of the project talks about 13 birds per year for the whole project. The environmental protection and RTG risk model speaks of 18 birds per year. For each project. We adopt the 18 birds. From our point of view, there are no significant differences between them and the approach of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Regarding the night survey, we purchased and used a professional team and a radar that was developed In Canada for the detection and identification of winged animals for the monitoring and identification of winged animals, not the identification of winged animals but the monitoring of winged animals. This survey in the end this radar is used by more than 70 bird research faculties. RTG Let's say Canada uses this project for bird signal detection and also the United States military. He also attacks research in academic works. This is a partial list and articles made about the radar. In the end, this radar knows its great advantage that it knows how to horizontally scan the risk area of ​​the turbines. You can also use it to characterize exactly the area where you want to measure. which is ultimately the project area. This radar eventually found a total of 187 winged birds at night, with 150 of them in the spring and 28,000 in the fall. A risk estimate in the end in the entire yellow area marked by the yellow polygon said 170,000 winged birds were detected. We made a statistical extrapolation that the radar From what to do, I don't see everything. There are areas he does not see. For each radar, even the second radar that surveys in Israel, a statistical extrapolation is performed for the amount of data that the radar saw. In the end, based on a risk model after 90 percent avoidance and we took stringent values, we are talking about 2.6 birds per project at night. Only at night In the end, the project's general risk estimate predicts the impact of 4 migratory birds per year. Regarding bats, the bat survey is again in agreement with the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We also held meetings about a bat survey. At the moment, meetings were held in which the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and especially RTG, said they had no further comments regarding -, regarding a bat survey. Bat activity in Kasra is considered low compared to other places. 60 percent of it is from a bat - which is a companion species of man. In the end, we also referred to this species in the survey. Our recommendation at the end is to make a detailed monitoring plan as a condition for a construction permit to be approved by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. And as long as significant damage is discovered, the content of an appropriate operating plan in coordination with RTG and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, for a significant reduction of the damage. It should be noted that today you can predict exactly when bats come out. They come out at a certain temperature, in the wind, at a certain wind speed and the speed of the turbines Only the turbine starts working. Therefore, it is possible to accurately predict when bats come out, they do not move around during the day, and if damage is detected, it is possible to reduce the damage significantly on the basis of a proper operation plan. Threshold values ​​At the time, we adopted the threshold values ​​plan that the district committee established here, also in relation to our other plan in the north of the Golan Heights in Ruach Berashit, which was also approved by Hotal. We understand that there is an aggravation here in relation to crowing birds of no as shown here is a value of 0.9 for crowing birds. We do not think this is true. But despite our opposition, we are ready to accept what the committee decides at this point. We are from Beck Let the committee, as it decided in the previous plans, leave some kind of opening for the inter-ministerial team and the planning manager to examine the matter and make a decision, accordingly, professionally on the matter and we will act accordingly. We will not be different from any other program. Regarding fire safety, Meir Harel is here, he is a firefighting consultant. He will soon introduce himself. will present the safety plan of this project. It should be noted that we met a number of times with both the district fire commission and a team that prepares the procedure for dealing with wind turbines. We presented the project to you. The project more or less complies with the level of its work plan. Prepared by Meir and Meir will present it now
Regarding public participation. In the end, we think that the best way to engage the public is to invite the public, present the project to them, and hear what they have to say. to respond and ultimately hear his opinion. Public participation here is done by I think the best people who carry out public participation in Israel and was recommended by Mr. Tobi Alfandari. according to his recommendation. This is how we carried out public participation. The public listen, no, it's impossible - it's very clear - it's very clear and there are people here. Whoever is here is opposed. In the end it's a subjective matter. some were In the end, the people who get public participation are the people who oppose wind turbines. Not the public that is in favor of wind turbines. OK. Again, I say. The process we did has it in the review. We did public participation in the process of presenting the project, frontally to the public. with all the ingredients. After we carried out an environmental impact survey, we realized the impact of the project on the area there. We invited the public and also through publication in the newspapers and publication on all the notice boards in all the settlements in the area. We invited the public to present the project to them. The public participation project was managed by Tobi Alfandari who is a public participation expert. We answered questions there. Beyond that? We went above and beyond what was required, we came to every regional council in the area there, we met with the regional council, the regional council also invited residents on its behalf, it should be noted that we did this more than once. It's not all shown. We came and presented the project here. We came to hear claims and questions presented to us regarding the project. We answered as best we could. OK. In terms of building rights - we are ultimately dependent here, this project is ultimately connected to a distribution network. When we are required to, at the moment between 3 and 4 buildings, which the electric company will eventually on the operating basis of the electric company in relation to construction percentages we still do not have this building. We took something in the end we didn't - basically, as I mentioned, we are a company with many circumstances in setting up wind projects both in Israel and in the world. We have a project under construction in the Baka Valley, this project includes 30 wind turbines that is fully coordinated with the Israel Police. And - , and - , in the end, he knows how to lead turbines to such a difficult place like the Golan Heights. This project was also carried out by a traffic report showing where to bring the turbine. The report was attached to the review and it is clear that we will carry, we know how to bring the turbines. We don't need to lower bridges. We use existing ways. If a specific road sign needs to be diverted or moved, of course this will be coordinated with the police and Israel Routes, or whoever is needed. to coordinate it. In the end, at the stage of licensing that is now coming - that you don't have a deposited plan and you don't know what it looks like to start coordinating it, that's not true. Because it is possible that such a turbine will not be in the end such a turbine will be. As you can see, this project started with 11 turbines and went down to 5. So we assume that after the plan is deposited, we will start coordination processes for licensing against the diameter of the arrival of the turbines as well. All on existing roads. We would not want anyone, neither the Ministry of Transportation nor Israel Routes to participate in the costs of transporting the turbines. It's all at the expense of - , (regarding the land) private ownership. We have proven it above and beyond. We have proven it beyond a reasonable doubt. in privately owned territories. What is not privately owned, I received consent from the Israel Land Authority, I have a letter that says that during licensing or in preparation for a building permit, we can come to the administration to make a transaction in accordance with the rules of the Israel Land Authority. This letter is given. Also found in the Electricity Authority. That's how we do it. All the wiring will be buried underground. In accordance with the approvals that the administration gave also in relation to this program. Turbine 11, the electricity company, will also bring the electricity to it.
We will not build a project that is not financially feasible. We will not invest so much money in it. B - A turbine starts working at 3 meters per second.",1,1,1,1,1,Support,1,"The statement provided indicates a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project. The speaker, likely a representative of the developing company, discusses various logistical aspects of the project, such as coordination with the Israel Police and Israel Routes for transportation of the turbines, adherence to regulations, and the use of existing infrastructure without the need for significant alterations. The mention of compliance with the Israel Land Authority and the Electricity Authority, as well as the emphasis on the financial feasibility and the technical details of the project (like underground wiring and turbine efficiency), further supports the notion that the project is being managed responsibly and in accordance with regulatory requirements. The speaker's focus on the logistical and regulatory compliance aspects of the project, without raising concerns about environmental impacts or community opposition, aligns with a supportive stance.

Deputy Fire Commissioner Acting Fire Commissioner. As said, we are here in a very detailed process coordinated with fire authorities. We held meetings with the North District, the Fire Commission and prepared a fire safety plan based on the fire safety regulations and instructions of the Fire Commission. The Fire Commission is currently engaged in the preparation of a commissioner's directive regarding the entire array of turbines in the State of Israel. Where, the standards and instructions are based on both European and American international standards. A central component in turbines in terms of fire safety, it should be understood that every modern turbine that is manufactured today has all the components of fire safety systems inside the turbine house. which includes detection systems for automatic fire extinguishing systems and a warning system for the center in a situation where there is a fire or a malfunction in the turbine house. The system immediately goes into action and extinguishes the fire. As above, there is a photo system from the turbines regarding what is happening in the turbine house and around the turbines. In addition to this, a water system located in the area of ​​the turbines that are supposed to be erected both in the torches and in Kasra, allows the fire brigades to carry out both water filling and requests for fires that may be around the turbine house. Basically, around the turbine there is A clear area of ​​10 meters of vegetation. Another 50 meters are thinned out in a situation where there are forests or woods around the turbine house. These are the summaries we have agreed with the fire commission and the North District Ministry. Thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,1,Support,1,"The statement provided focuses on detailing the comprehensive fire safety measures implemented in the wind turbine project, highlighting coordination with fire authorities, adherence to both local and international standards, and the installation of advanced fire safety systems within the turbines.

On the issue of fires, the main problem is not what's inside the turbine, but the issue of extinguishing it within the radius. We have here documents from KKL-Junk that oppose what you say . And they set a radius of 600 meters around the turbine, it was already said in previous discussions that in the fires that were two years ago, if there were turbines then today, for example, plowmen and a pioneer and it was impossible - they could not be extinguished. So if we can refer to that as well. Regarding the threshold values, I didn't exactly understand what you said. I understand bottom line that you align with the threshold values ​​document.",1,0,0,1,1,Neutral,-0.5,"The statement reflects concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly focusing on the issues of fire safety and public participation. The speaker references opposition documents from KKL-Junk that challenge the project's safety measures, specifically the adequacy of a 600-meter safety radius around turbines in case of fires. This indicates doubts about the project's ability to manage and mitigate risks effectively. Additionally, the speaker's request for clarification on threshold values and public participation suggests a demand for more information and possibly better compliance with regulatory standards. The overall tone and content lean towards questioning the adequacy and safety of the project rather than supporting it.

And if the main roads you are 784 if I remember correctly. Does 784 give you an answer?

The visibility of a turbine that is 140 m high, you will see it in the distance. I checked if it was possible to put in large turbines, we deliberately chose to put in small turbines considering the views. I will gladly send you the comparison we made of the scenic effect of a large turbine in relation to the number of small turbines, according to the mountainous topography in which this area is located. Regarding the electricity network, we tested at the initial level, the possibility of connecting to existing electricity without creating a new infrastructure. We received a positive answer that in fact all our turbines are connectable if approved, and no new power lines are needed either.  There is fencing only for the turbine, not for the cluster. Since these are short turbines, no new ways are needed. We previously met with a representative of the Ministry of Environmental Protection for an initial consultation on a different plan.

We can go back to the big plan, take down the irrelevant turbines, how irrelevant they are we don't know, we can hear it, and continue with the same decision. The proportion is not the matter of the power of the turbines, our matter is the impact on the environment. Scenic effect, 40 meters is a ten-story structure.  

I want to say, the instructions, as soon as the Ministry of Defense does not approve, it is a shame for us to handle it. Because once again, this is one office that has a veto. And we cannot come and demand that the Ministry of Defense approve it, and create pressure on the Ministry of Defense that the planning institutions approved and you did not.

In this plan, we actually presented everything we want to do in the Galilee, although it was not recorded in the protocol, we did not ask for it to be recorded, but we stated that we were going to submit separate plans for a small turbine farm. In fact, the big plan we presented was reduced, we went from a large amount of turbines to a much smaller amount. We're at least halfway there. As a result of several reasons: one of the reasons is the plans that exist for the council, the Kisra-Samia local council, and taking them into account, that's why we didn't submit either, in fact there were 14 plans at the beginning that we wanted to submit, we canceled the submission of six plans, as a result of an understanding with them and a desire to work in cooperation, and not under pressure. The remaining eight programs are actually in eight complexes. We will call it sub-complexes, relatively distant from each other, some of them you can even distinguish, in the same sub-complex, also two small farms, which lie next to each other, so we decided to present it because it is good for understanding at the environmental level and the effects. To the best of our understanding, we have prepared all the aspects or requirements that we have seen in accordance with what appears in the instructions of TAMA 10 / d / 12, we have prepared all the appendices as required for the submission of a plan. Not yet for the permit, there are other components of the permit, which we will of course complete in accordance with the requirements and instructions The TMA We also forwarded the revised landscape reports, because we improved them after we did a repeated review to see that it was suitable for TMA, so we submitted revised reports that contain more material, and in fact are supposed to answer each of the questions and everything that is involved in a landscape report according to the definitions of scenic reports in TMA. As we understand it. It may take more to complete. The Krieger-Shibolt company is actually the entrepreneur of the program. She submits the plan together with the, thanks to the power of attorney of the land owners. There are contact documents between each of the land owners. Krieger-Oat owns contracts, for each plot of land we have an arranged contract with powers of attorney from the landowners for us to act. We transferred, submitted the contracts. Yes. I would like to update a few points: a. Since the previous discussion, we have received sweeping approval from the Civil Aviation Authority for all turbines. We also received permission for the turbines, with the exception of a reservation for 2-3 turbines from the Ministry of Defense. Reservation for specific turbines. Not by and large what we are asking for is the same specific plans, to put it under the conditions of the Ministry of Defense, and upon completion, then there will be continued care. I have no problem with it.
: Let me explain. The reason we speak with such full confidence is because we also did a preliminary check with the electric company, for every point, because at the end of the day we will make the consumer series for all the turbines. Which means that I will request a connection, so the electric company, I asked them for each of the N.C., to confirm that I receive a connection. A connection will not be accepted, they will not give me permission if there is no way to get there. This was explained to me at the electric company, so they checked it for me a long time ago. I will divide this into two parts. A. Regarding the issue of access, we are on each location of a turbine, we did a field tour, with a vehicle, and we arrived physically. I mean, what you're talking about, rotations and problems and such, since we're talking about 50 kilowatt turbines, these are turbines whose wing length is 8 meters, which is roughly the length of a normal agricultural truck, which goes through there every day. Truck... not in our plots. We checked each way, to make sure I don't have a problem transferring, and I will also explain why. An 8 meter wing is not that big. But I can't get to the point where, as you mentioned before, an engineering project. I can't now start investing in engineering projects and going through rounds. That's why I checked the roads one by one, I don't mind going on a field trip with you, showing you one by one that we've made sure that these are the places we can reach, in such a way that I have no problem with neither slope, nor steepness, nor bringing equipment. It doesn't pay for me to take a 50 kilowatt turbine that costs $200,000 and go invest in an engineering project of another $200,000. It doesn't make economic sense. It doubles the costs, you don't do things like that. You only go where there is. That's why our touch in the field will be minimal to zero, we don't touch the field. If we have exceptional cases, I don't believe we will have any, the turbine itself is 2 tons. The blades... .. Let's put it this way, it's not huge turbines, it's 50 kilowatt turbines that are made all over the world, there are 100,000 of them that exist without engineering projects because it's not profitable.",0,1,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They emphasize the practical aspects of turbine installation, such as confirming accessibility and minimal environmental impact, and they discuss coordination with the electric company to ensure compliance with necessary conditions for connection. The speaker also highlights the economic rationale behind their decisions, noting that the costs of additional engineering projects would not be justifiable, which aligns with a focus on efficient project implementation. They reassure that the turbines are of a manageable size and that their installation will be minimally invasive, which suggests an effort to address potential concerns while emphasizing the feasibility and practicality of the project.

The first move was that, following a request from the settlement, some of the turbines were removed from the list, since the developer removed all turbines that are 500 meters or less from residences or employment areas from the plan.

Another thing, apparently, according to the provisions of TMA 10 /d/ 12 medium turbines, assuming that the plan submits up to 9 medium turbines, it is not obligated to an environmental document.

In 2015 we arrived at the committee and had an initial meeting with the green team of the North District Committee. Accordingly, we submitted Polygons to the inter-ministerial committee. Basically 4 different complexes. They were all disqualified except for this polygon they showed you earlier, so I won't expand on it, of the inter-ministerial committee. We originally submitted 23 large turbines and another 20 medium turbines. We received very large comments from the Ministry of Environmental Protection on the report we submitted, accordingly we made extensive changes according to their request, today this is all that remains of the plan. All the corrections that followed our meeting with the Tefen council. These are the corrections we made because of reference to the environmental protection opinion. It's all there in the presentation. These are the changes we made. I will try very hard to do it quickly. A lot of turbines were taken down. Move from the eastern side that the committee asked not to get close to, move many turbines towards the west, still in line, excuse me Yonathan, the draft not of - , of the draft that the committee submitted. The situation today looks like this when since yesterday we moved two more turbines at the meeting we had in Tefen which are at rest. In the end, we were left with 4 large turbines and one medium one. Regarding the medium-sized turbines, the committee will have its say. Someone said that we don't have a picture of the whole situation here. So I'm saying already, every review of our environmental protection in accordance with the request made by the committee, and in accordance with the guidelines of the review, were carried out in a strict manner as if both Enlight's project was found and our project was found. Therefore, all the tests of the noise, all the vibration tests, all the infrasound tests, carrying birds, everything took into account that both projects are working fully, 100 percent and not 80 percent full together, so our results are a little different. What we will see later. We have also looked at the results of me sitting here from the RAS. She already sees that there are some signs here about things that we might later - then we will agree on them at the objections stage. Which will greatly benefit the condition of the turbines as well. Yes. The two plans are together. The two plans are together. The company has About 50 megawatts is a conditional license and it received approvals for all the turbines with one or the other restrictions from the Ministry of Defense. If we had 205, sorry, 13 turbines. As for medium turbines instead of 24 - I think we are 17 today There are 12 turbines - until yesterday, I think we are at 1, which we are asking the committee for, mainly for the needs of experiments and if there is a need to shut down large turbines, when we do new technologies for birds, etc. Planning aspects - we were required for an access route to the turbines and a question was asked here - by the head of the council. We have a small part of a private route with which we have an agreement, so that there will be no problem with the private roads, including the extensions, we will move on. This project will provide about 24 households. A thousand households will receive electricity from it. It is less important that it will reach five - according to all the surveys received from the electricity company, and from there it will go to the national electricity grid. There are special arrangements between the entrepreneurs for the preference of locals for places of employment. So maybe the first project that has a combination between Druze and Jews. There are both the Lapidot and the Druze here. Perhaps the biggest project in the Druze sector today. There was no such project. It will create employment for hundreds of families during the construction. to dozens of families during operation. There is an obligation of the entrepreneurs, both towards the councils and towards the investing companies, to give preference within the framework of First Ofer also to local contractors from the area. I don't want to go into the add-on anymore. Maybe Mofid I will give you a few words to talk about the benefit to the area. There is a map here that shows the draft. I will go over it because Jonathan said it is not, not binding. What is more, for all the distances of the turbines from all the settlements. We specifically mentioned one turbine, Turbine 7, which is indeed at rest, but its results are much, much, much below what is required according to the standards. Tefen is an industrial area and it does include Tefen. Because in an industrial zone the required threshold for noise is 70 decibels according to guidelines and not 40 as in residences. Much better there too. including jitter. I'm thinking of giving - Where's Yoram? If you can explain about the noise issue. I'll pass. I will emphasize that Yoram told what we also did on the issue of infra sound. Also on the subject of noise. Regarding all the turbines in the space. Gentlemen, not only for ours, but also for the previous entrepreneur. So that we know exactly what happens if all the turbines work together 100 percent of the time. How does it affect the settlements? Nowadays, since the turbines are already really a tool that is common in hundreds of thousands in the world, they have long been included in all the acoustic noise calculation software. We work with very heavy programming. In each software we indicate what is the source of noise. When a noise source receives full characterization that it stems from the manufacturer's data, the manufacturer does its tests. We always believe the manufacturer but we also like to check separately. That's why we also have a very large library on the whole topic of wind turbine acoustics. Because this topic is very - very hot. And really, very big works are being done, in - , in - , all over the world. And this data is data that is mostly shared thank goodness for the internet. Except for one thing, friends, among the tests done by Yoram for today, 5 more turbines went down. This means that we have here a rather large margin of noise, which is taken into account and will not be in practice. This turbine is located 560 meters, from the spot of the village of Lapidot. this. 560 meters from the spot of the village of Lapidot. Now explain to me how",1,1,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement provided discusses various aspects of a wind turbine project, focusing on noise impact assessments and compliance with standards. The speaker mentions that the noise levels from the turbines are well below the required standards, even in an industrial area where the threshold is higher. They also highlight the use of advanced software for acoustic noise calculations and the efforts to verify manufacturer data independently. The mention of coordination with authorities and adherence to guidelines suggests a proactive approach to managing environmental impacts. The speaker does not demand additional studies or express doubts about the project's compliance, which indicates support for the project's continuation and effectiveness in addressing potential concerns.

Mofid Merai on the part of the entrepreneurs. from the developer. In general, the idea of ​​the project is to really create industrial employment, especially in the Druze villages, after that join the Fides. The socio-economic status of the Druze communities is low. I don't want to check on any research, I did my degree in the development of industry in the Druze settlements, which in general led me to the level of the whole place of initiating projects in the Druze sector. At the beginning of the road, by the way, there was talk of more settlements. The inter-ministerial committee took down Beit Gan, took down Horfish, we stayed - , no. There is a horn. That is, a certain percentage of the profits is a fund that goes to the settlements themselves. Not in the councils, for the residents themselves. Let the representatives in the fund determine that the fund will be for the welfare of the residents in accordance with the decision of the residents. And this is part of the income or profits, apart from what is said here about the employment and employment of the people we obliged the investors with 50 percent of the workers who will be residents of the place. Some of them will also really bring employment to communities that have nothing to do, communities that have nothing to do, that live in a place where they also have private land. can no one can stop that everyone will profit fairly. And that's the motto, that's what we aimed for and that's what we aim for. win win - win You can do something that I will finish. A question was asked about Beit Gan Horfis (not clear, far from the microphone) he confirmed it in his council. There was the plan of 42 turbines. Why was it downloaded? The program has been in existence for over 5 years. With your predecessor there was a discussion including here and in this place, in a public debate that was in this place, you can repeat the protocols including in the Knesset. There was a bush. There was also public participation, I suggest that Avigdor also mention. You are misrepresenting it.

You see that we pass a maximum order of magnitude of 9 meters per second. All our calculations of the noise distribution due to the wind were done at a speed of 10 meters per second. This is an extreme situation in terms of noise. further. Collectors were scattered throughout the inhabited areas, you see there is a very large number of collectors. And we will do a detailed analysis for each of these collectors to know what the noise level is planned from all the turbines when they all work simultaneously at maximum speed. forward. The analysis The results of the analysis are in front of you. The red lines you see the red contours are the limits where the noise level reaches the criterion value. You see the marking of the turbines, around the turbines there is a blue line - this line is the line he made, I said permitted. The green line outside DBA 40 - the red line is a line of DBA 45 where the noise level is already 5 dB below the standard. You see here that nowhere do we have a situation where the value of DBA 35 to which it is the 40th limit value, reaches a populated area. The overall noise levels when all the turbines are working noisily and you have DBA 40 here - maximum as I said, wind 10 meters per second, you can see the line of some of them very - very far away and how many DBA 40 - diagram in each of the settlements in all of them we are below them in a way less far. Regarding the serious accusation that I steal an opinion and ignore it. I'm sorry I was misunderstood. The work done - on wind turbines, is precisely for the reason that wind turbines are sources of noise and we know they are sources of noise.

Finally, I want to say something about the noise. I will start again with public sharing. I have here the public participation from the survey. There is no date on it, but in my opinion it is a public sharing of the old plan, which no longer exists today, which is written here that the plan includes 60 turbines, etc. - etc. So obviously this is not the plan. Now I want to say, I am looking here because it is detailed here, there was a survey, etc. D. Once again, I am familiar with the TMA guidelines and I raise this in almost every program because it is not done properly in my opinion, in every program. I will give you an example. 11 people were asked in Lapidot. 10 people were asked in Halutz. 16 in Harshim. ' in Kfar Vardim 81. While the TMA explicitly defines that when conducting a poll, people should understand what they are voting on. You have to explain to them. They should be shown chapter 4 in a te-te review. Since I work a lot with the public not only in turbines, I tell you the public does not understand what about the planning. He doesn't know what a review is. He doesn't know what a committee is. He doesn't know what resistance is. He doesn't know all these things. If you don't do real information with the participation of the public, then people also don't know - what they are voting for. Not only that our knowledge is accumulated and accumulated, I tell you I'm ready to put my hands on it and tell you if you do a new, thorough survey in the area today, you won't get these results. You will not receive support for this program. In huge numbers. And it is not certain that it will all be based on knowledge even then. But it is much more knowledge than today and the number of participants. I mean, when you bring us a question survey like this, I, as a committee member, cannot rely on it. This is one point. I will briefly touch on the subject of the fires. If you claim that there is another document of other radii that there is no radius of 500 meters around a turbine or 600 meters. Flight shutdown radii around the turbines, if there is a document that has other radii than we know, please show it. I don't know anything else right now. Regarding the district policy that is being talked about here, which actually says 500 meters from the standard. I put your current plan on the map of the spots with 500 meters, guys - you have 3 turbines left that can even be erected, they do not comply with the district's policy at all. I mean - 9 plus a radius of 500 meters is the map. I'm no longer / I took the district layer of the village patch from TMM / 2 talking about the interpretation that it is a thousand. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the graphic interpretation of what the district policy says. If you want I can project You will see that there are maybe 4 or 5 turbines left in the area that you bring to us - within these radii. I reflect on the situation. So I want to say something about the noise. I - , I want to say it after What we heard here is that the government's environmental protection and health authorities set up the nearest farm 1060 meters away, and the council's engineer sat here a month ago and said , I am the only one in the country who has experience with turbines that are not described, that are placed - that I signed these permits, today I am not ready to sign them because I made a mistake and my residents are suffering. Now, now, I want to - , I want to read you something really tiny, really, really tiny. OK? In December 2015, the Ministry of Health published its reference regarding the distances of turbines from settlements. I read you exactly 2 first. Studies have been published with conflicting findings in the field. In addition, there is a lack of studies on long-term exposure to infrasound. The review of the literature indicates that there is a possibility that there is a direct link between the proximity of the turbines and health consequences such as concentration difficulties, sleep disturbances and annoyance, in addition to noise measurements conducted in various parts of the world, it appears that at a distance of a thousand meters or more there is a chance, etc. On this basis, in most countries they have decided to prohibit the construction of turbines in close proximity to residences at ranges varying between 500 meters and 3 thousand meters, and in a number of countries such as Denmark, Germany and Australia there is a charge for seasonal noise measurements. Accordingly, since there is no unequivocal information regarding the consequences of an infrasonic noise hazard on the health of the residents, the Ministry of Health suggests, etc. Now, a person who advises you cannot sit here and say here that there are no health effects from turbines. Guys, this is irresponsibility that borders on misleading the public. I'm letting you know that. Responsible after reading endless studies. It cannot be that this statement will be here and people will think that everything is fine. Not enough research, it's like that with any new technology. And until there is research, then it already turns out that people are suffering. It was important for me to say this because, because we have to set things straight. It is impossible to make statements here that there are no health problems from turbines. While the world at least recognizes that there is not enough research to determine this. That's why the preventive caution and we see the trend in the world of large turbines, and the studies are also growing. Because there is no other way to deal with it. I said that about noise. Last thing, no. moment. second. I just want to say something. Both Zodiac programs together. I don't know about mediums, mediums have a drop, but in the larges it's exactly 4 that are not found.

The speaker seems to be questioning the rationale behind decisions made, particularly regarding the distances chosen and their implications for wildlife and possibly human settlements. The reference to a decision that ""doesn't stand"" and questioning ""Why did you decide on bats?"" indicates a challenge to the adequacy of the project's consideration of environmental impacts, particularly on bats.

The previous head of the council who lost the elections by a high percentage lost because of the turbines. I state this at the beginning of my words. Because he was in favor he was also a 10 percent partner in Zodiac according to a document I have from him. So - , I was chosen for the purity of this thing. I told the residents I am against turbines. It was also a large percentage for me, with the support I received from the residents. OK? This is important to note. First point, the plenary council here is against turbines. Unanimously. He was also the head of the council. The council's plenary decided unanimously against the turbines. I want my voice to be. Good. The sharing procedure that we had was a procedure that was not fair, it was not transparent and there was a serious problem with it among the residents, because certain people were chosen and with them they did the sharing. As if they shared they didn't even understand what this thing was about. By and large, and also answer me that I'm done, please. And also stimulated them and enticed them financially. Yes. There was a misrepresentation to these people. And of course the one who pushed for it was the previous head of the council. Especially the close people. The next section in this regard, turbine layout from our point of view was not on a contractual basis, it was on the basis of contracts that were signed and not on the basis of an optimal engineering formula that was tested. And not on the basis of utilizing a wind resource which was not a consideration at all. The district committee, at a meeting held on September 18, 2017, was told - by the company - that the income per acre of olive groves is 4500 NIS, compared to an income of between 20 and 30 thousand NIS. Here I say to my Mofid friends - for a year. per year. First - every time you reduced the turbines, then you also reduced the income. it's clear. On the other hand, the 20,000 NIS that were promised will probably not raise the socio-economic level in the rest of Gat for Kfar Vardim. What I am saying is taken from the minutes that were in the yeshiva. The economy that when this thing is restored the council's income from the property tax will be much more than the turbines. It will provide an answer to all the residents and not the small handful that are called from the turbines 6 lots were sold a month ago. The assistant also bought one of the 6. We are in discussion with the committee to plan and find alternatives for veterans. The turbines will definitely hurt us and reduce this option. I agree with my friends that the distance is less than 500 meters. I'm also disdainful of what my friends say, and it's as if it's allowed in the village of Roses. The turbines are also prohibited in my area No doubt, it is factually true. And the paths that lead to these turbines are paved. They need to be expanded, work needs to be done there. That it will also damage this entire strip that will lead to and reach the turbines and also the neighbors who were also promised money and a lot of money. The council's vision. In my vision, I have 6 sections, the first section #2 is proper management. The second is to brand Yanoch Gat touristically. Here, if I want to implement this vision and I'm a giant step away, the turbines will hurt my vision. They will also affect my income, why did I put him No. 2? Because as soon as I strengthen the tourism issue and automatically the Druze heritage house will be built there which will bring in tourists from all over the world and not just from Israel, and I want it and I see it as a vision and a goal that can strengthen the residents economically, the turbines will put a barrier in my way. No. This will not strengthen the vision and will not get us anywhere good. It is about the contribution of employing people. Maybe at the beginning in the establishment later there will be no transaction. Maybe yes the deal in - , in a very - very - very limited number. That's why it won't give any answer and won't change the status at rest. I would prefer to open a factory for assembly and soldering and packaging, so it would result in the employment of many more workers. We are in a green area, which has a nature reserve. Those who do not know Yanoch are welcome to do so. An amazing place, a natural forest, one of the most beautiful in Israel and we must not take the risk of restricting the flight of firefighting planes. In addition to what is said here. The construction of the turbines at this height will limit and prevent firefighting flights and will also damage the spectacular view that is there. Regarding noise I touched on it but I don't want to add. I understand that the Zodiac company and the companies that are supposed to set this thing up. They are net economic companies. All their intentions are to rake in profits and that's fine. But it won't help us. It will only hurt. There will be a serious injury to the value of the land, a very serious injury.

First of all, something terribly strange, this plan is actually in its first version, it does not apply at all to the Meshav planning area. At first they immediately scattered dozens of turbines all over the Galilee. As a result of the discussions here, instructions were given for the review of the impact on the environment, etc. And started some kind of contacts of the company with all kinds of parties. Now I know one mechanism to change the plan before the deposit. It is a decision of a planning institution that decided to deposit the plan. He can deposit the plan with the conditions and then the plan changes according to the decision of the local committee. An amazing thing is happening here. The plan changes, location of turbines, quantity of turbines, layout of turbines changes, moreover - some of the turbines are even offered on my planning space. A local committee from Mesgav did not see this plan at all. Like, didn't discuss her. No - , not anything.

You will not review, I know that the Ministry of Environmental Protection did not refer to this new program at all. And I'm already asking myself, how does this thing happen?

Those of 500 meters and 1000 meters from our settlements now, this only applies to Mashgav settlements. Sitting here - , the chairman of the committee, our neighbors from Lapidot are sitting here, which just as much as it relates to the towns of Misgav, it also hurts them because the distances between the western turbines between Lapidots are only a few hundred meters. So I guess there is someone here who would like to express himself on this matter. I'm just saying, this whole plan of turbines in a systemic way, is an invalid plan.

The turbine review is a very complex review, we submitted it almost a year ago. At this time, we were asked by the Ministry of Environmental Protection to prepare two round completions. At the same time, a survey of winged animals, a survey of bats, was also submitted at the same time, reviewed, and part of today's discussion is based on this survey. In this process, we are actually in this location that is in the Yatir Forest, a transition zone between the climate and the Mediterranean region, in the north of the Negev, and the Judean Desert, an area that is very interesting and very important from a biological point of view, from a climatic point of view, and some of the issues we dealt with are also the ecological issue and the ecological implications , both on birds and animals. A topic of alternatives, we actually also referred to macro-regional alternatives, that within this territory of the Yatir region, in fact the best energy deployment alternative is along the ridge, only that there we are in an area that is already extremely problematic, we are also located in a very prominent area, and we are already on the edge Or even coincides with the nature reserve, the Tel Kiryot reserve, which is located here. It is very difficult to see how this project can be applied to the ridge and to a row of turbines, therefore our recommendation originally or as an initial alternative we looked at two area cells in two areas, we called it northern and southern, a wider alternative and when we examined the alternatives we came to the conclusion that it is more correct to reduce and be in the northern area and this is the macro alternative we preferred The same, that it meets the variety of considerations that examined them, with the exception of the energy issue where the priority is really on an alternative to the ridge. There is an interest here in both a scenic element and an element of the ability to obtain the land. Margins of agricultural plots within Yatir Forest, not on the forest areas themselves, but the detailed plan for Yatir Forest defines agricultural plots, within which we are on the edges of the plots. Each turbine occupies basically the mast anchored to the ground in a 20-meter concrete foundation, and this is the occupation of the land that is below the ground and on the ground we are in about half a dunam, with another construction area and a maintenance area, so we are on the edge of the agricultural plots. Just to say something more about alternatives, within our macro alternative, the northern region, we examined alternatives of a number of turbines in relation to the height of the turbines, that is, at the moment we examined 15 turbines of 150 meters compared to 13 turbines of 180 meters upper blade height. Our conclusion is basically in almost all the issues, noise, breaches, landscape, radiation, in all these issues it is better to reduce the number of turbines, even though they are a little higher, this of course has a slightly greater scenic effect, but we think from all these professional sides, that it is more correct to reduce the number of turbines, also based on the price of their elevation. The subject of jitter is a modern subject, we encounter it in similar landscapes in the shading of buildings, but jitter from turbines is a modern subject. We solved it in a very professional way with software dedicated to the subject called Win Pro. Basically the meaning of flickering is the passage of the sun behind the turbine and casting a shadow on the blades for sensitive uses that are on the other side, beyond the turbine blades. Usually this happens in our area in the early morning hours, late evening hours and a little after sunrise and a little before sunset. This means that there can be a shadow falling on a desk or office table at certain times. We know exactly which turbine - so I want to say, the effect is of a shadow that is found for someone who sits and studies or works at a table or in the living room of a residence, and we know how to analyze exactly and say in every collector in every settlement which turbine casts a shadow, when, on what day of the year and for how many minutes per year Our examination showed that, in total, from the entire region there are several receivers in the second settlement, which may really receive such a jitter. Now there are a variety of criteria, the criterion we went to, is the criterion of Western Europe, of Germany, of thirty hours of shaking per year or thirty minutes of shaking per day. We the entrepreneurs undertake that we will not exceed this criterion, we will offer a precise mechanism in the construction permit phase, which says that turbines --- if there is a potential for exceeding this criterion. Therefore, the issue of a jitter effect is not expected, but at a minimum and beyond that, actions will be taken, and this is a commitment of the developer that will be anchored in the statutes of the program",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They discuss the evaluation of different turbine configurations and conclude that fewer but taller turbines would be preferable, despite a slightly greater scenic impact. They also address concerns about noise, breaches, landscape, and radiation, suggesting that these issues are better managed with the chosen configuration. Additionally, the speaker explains how the issue of ""jitter"" or shadow flicker caused by the turbines is professionally managed using specific software and adheres to Western European standards. They commit to not exceeding these standards and propose a mechanism to ensure compliance during the construction permit phase. This indicates a proactive approach to addressing potential environmental and community impacts, aligning with guidelines and demonstrating coordination with regulatory requirements.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Environmental organizations,"I would like to present a short presentation that will put the members of the committee into the context of the construction of the turbines and the forest area where the turbines are located. We all know the turbines are located in Yatir Forest, the largest forest in the country, 130,000 dunams, millions of trees. The areas that we would like to refer to in the entire detailed review that we provided in August and after that in September to those with wings, refers mainly to three areas. First of all, the effect of the turbines on the functioning of the forest as a public receiver and as an ecosystem. Imposing restrictions on the firefighting system, B. Possible harm to the wingmen. The location of the turbines as we see in the forest is permissible, all the turbines are almost touching the forests, very densely wooded areas. If we bring up TMA 22 against this background, we see that apart from the two turbines marked with red circles, all the turbines are at the interface either fully or partially with TMA 22, TMA 22 which was actually detailed in the Yatir Yatir plan and within the framework of which agricultural plots were given to the settlements and the agricultural areas Doiko, on which the turbines are planned to be built. As Oded pointed out, it is a metropolitan recreation area in itself, as defined in Amendment 23 14, as is also defined in the policy document in the Yatir Metropolitan Recreation Area Here animals, plants, water bodies, sites that attract the public, archeology and the entire area is managed by the KKL-Junk. Our vision as it will be translated in the master plan for this area includes the development and continued extensive development of the forest through bicycle paths, pedestrian paths, site development Audiences like --- in the vicinity of the turbines. Our vision is the following of more travelers in the forest. We see here a schematic map of the forest and in fact we can see all the expansion and arrival of a new population in the area, whether it is the addition of housing units, the expansion of the planned settlements Shani Livna and Mount Amsha, new settlements that will bring a large population here in Betir and the settlement of Hiran and increased activity in the youth camp in Beit Hieran in Betir Yes, the plan is in this area, we have to remember that the entire area here is saturated with agricultural areas, we don't know if the turbines will end here or if we will get waves additional programs on all areas of the forest. We don't know how to estimate the effect of the turbines on the contents of the forest, on the animals, we don't know how to say what the effect of the turbines will be clearly in terms of vibration, in terms of noise, in terms of infrasound, on everything we have just presented there are several aspects of the turbines on the interface of forest fires excessive. From the analysis that KKL conducts of the fires in all our forests, it appears that there have been dozens of fires from 2008 until today in the Yatir Forest, in large areas. The last meeting in February of the inter-ministerial team on wind turbines, we received a reference from the Civil Aviation Authority's RTA regarding the issue of imposing flight restrictions around turbines. The restrictions in the past were a hundred meters of flight from turbines and in their latest reference they grew to 500 meters, to half a kilometer from a turbine yes, firefighting planes, we translated their proposal to this entire buffer area, we can see that the entire area of ​​the forest that is north of Mount Amsha actually does not benefit from air cover of the fire brigade. The aspect - we are talking about an area of ​​almost 3000 dunams by the way, the second aspect of the forest interface and the fires, is actually the creation of fire buffer elements, as we received in the developers' reference to the forest interface, we understood that there is a very reasonable possibility that we will be required to produce fire buffer lines, around each turbine . These buffer lines actually consist of two strips, A. a 26-meter strip of sterile area and another 50-meter strip of tree thinning. If we - translate this whole thing into trees for felling according to a key of 50 I want to point out, we are already nearing completion, I really want to point out that as part of the review documents already in August we asked for an opinion from the fire authority and we did not receive one, and we are basing ourselves on a document we received in the review . The meaning for us right now is the potential felling of over 2000 trees, these 2000 trees are actually joined by the felling of about 700 trees in favor of laying an infrastructure strip. B. cutting down over 1000 additional trees in order to widen the roads required for transporting the turbine and adjusting the radii for the trucks. In total, we are talking about over 4000 trees to cut down. Winged you want us to relate, don't you?",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The statement expresses significant concerns about the environmental impacts of the wind turbine project, particularly regarding its effects on the forest, wildlife, and fire safety measures. The speaker highlights uncertainties about the project's impact on animal life and the forest ecosystem, including noise, vibration, and infrasound effects. They also discuss the substantial increase in area required for fire safety measures around the turbines, which would lead to the felling of thousands of trees. These concerns are coupled with a lack of sufficient response from relevant authorities (e.g., the fire authority) to their requests for assessments, indicating a dissatisfaction with the current handling and evaluation of the project's environmental impacts.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Planning bodies,"Hello everyone, today we are discussing an environmental impact survey and a survey of wing owners on the issue of wind turbines, further to the committee's decision from January 8, 2017. I just want to say that we have a tendency to put an end to this discussion. I mean we will discuss, decide, sit down, when he needs to make a decision. By the way, I have not yet seen a patent that allows you to make alternative energy not on any kind of land, with land that has some value and some kind of price that needs to be paid to make renewable energy. The worst thing in my opinion is to discuss for years and not make decisions. There will be a certain price, in the end this committee will have to make a decision to understand what the price is and there is a debate about that, it needs to be resolved so that we understand what the price is and then the members of the committee will decide whether it is worth paying this price, in order to receive the spiritual energy at the level that can be obtained in this program. That's why today I really want the discussion to be really about the question, the price question. This means that the editors of both the environmental impact survey and the winged survey will explain in a few words what the findings are. There are responses from RTG that we only received today or yesterday and from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We will clarify questions and decide at the end of the discussion, we will decide what the next steps are with timetables, so who - I just want to clarify, we have an agenda, we define exactly, we define exactly if This is a discussion for the deposition or another discussion. Today is not a discussion for the deposition, it is a discussion on the overview, at the same time I said at the beginning that we do not intend to have endless discussions now but to set a schedule, we will start today, we will try to answer the questions and the comments that were made and get answers and I Presumably we will have another discussion at our office, a professional discussion and we will definitely bring it to a decision.",0,0,0,1,1,Support,0,"The speaker in the statement appears to be focused on progressing the discussion about the wind turbine project by addressing the environmental and financial concerns and moving towards a decision. The emphasis on not wanting endless discussions and setting a schedule for decision-making suggests a pragmatic approach to resolving outstanding issues. The mention of coordinating responses from environmental groups and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and discussing the findings of environmental and winged surveys, indicates an effort to comply with regulatory and environmental standards. However, the speaker does not explicitly endorse the project, nor do they dismiss the concerns raised; instead, they stress the importance of understanding and resolving these issues to make an informed decision.

I will say three things, one - since the survey of the scouts is a survey --- and there are days that were made as Shiron pointed out here, by tired scouts and so on, the necessary corrections should have been made, they were not made and this should be done.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Environmental organizations,"Zohar North, Director of the KKL-Jden Planning and Southern Region Department, this is the background, we want to refer to the review, also to the report on the consequences of the forest which is the basis for the review and the guidelines --- the review regarding the consequences on treatment of --- so first of all I will say in a general statement that in our view also The report and the instructions for the review are very superficial and they are based very little on data that was closed to us and we were not asked to bring it and a lot on facts and memories, some of them 15 years ago that are not relevant to today. In short, the subject of the fires, the review states that there is one fire from unreported sources and another fire One, we have collected dozens of fires in the last seven or eight years, some of which are tens of dunams, so there are fires in the Yatir forest and there are dozens, not two as written The fires, and it is true, do not have an understory, but there is an almost complete coverage of needles, and they are sensitive needles, and they are a wonderful fuel, it is true that it does not ignite the tops, it causes ground fires, but there are fires here and there are in the understory The American in which it is written that the US Forest Service is going in the direction of wind turbines. There is a report from 2005 that is quoted in many places, but unfortunately there is a misinterpretation of the facts, I don't think that the American forestry report, whoever reads it, sets two rules that what falls under these rules will not have wind turbines here, one a distance of less than three kilometers from residences , two the average area is over twenty percent and according to the survey the average slope of the turbine area is 25%. In addition, when you check the source of the US Forestry Service and rely on them, all the recommendations on turbine areas are in the great plains, almost nowhere in the report are mountain forest areas a top priority, so even when you cite, please bring the documents and facts accurately. In addition, this is a document where researchers from Ireland are quoted in 1946 that I looked for turbines and found no turbines. There is a comparison to the Lahav Forest in Tzalim, in the Lahav Forest there are many more fires, therefore there is a danger there and there is a need for aerial extinguishing and in the Yatir Forest, no, that is true, but when you examine the nature and pattern of the fires, this pattern of land fires is an absolutely identical pattern. The reason why there are more fires in Lahav Forest is that Lahav Forest is today the second most popular forest in the State of Israel. Humans travel and start fires. We are in the process of accelerating to increase the number of visitors to the Yatir Forest, as above for all the settlements that Gavi mentioned here, the number of people is going to increase and the number of fires is going to increase. At the end of the forestry report it is written that there is no need for aerial firefighting, because there is no danger of fires from aerial firefighting and in the same sentence they recommend finding alternatives For aerial firefighting, there is a very strange paradox here, that the editor of the report on the one hand says that there is no danger of fires, then he recommends expanding buffer lines, widening roads, and in the next sentence he writes that damage to trees should also be reduced, all these things do not fit with logic, there is no fire protection , we need to find an alternative. The alternative is to cut down trees. I mean, this report gives all kinds of representations that I don't see any grasp of their reality, and there is a very dramatic effect on the functioning of the forest and the capacity of the forest. Turn it off. There aren't enough answers here and the review is very, very superficial in my view on these matters and I don't think we can accept in a situation where we have two settlements, each living on the border of the firefighting limits and it's impossible to get there with firefighting planes, to accept such statements that they don't --- and based on very unclear sources and run with it and say it's okay, it's not okay",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the adequacy of the environmental assessments and the management of potential impacts related to the wind turbine project. They question the validity and applicability of the data used to support the project, such as the relevance of historical data and the comparison of different forest areas with distinct characteristics. The speaker also highlights the paradoxes and inconsistencies in the reports, suggesting that the conclusions drawn are not logically sound or adequately addressing the real risks, particularly regarding fire hazards and forest management. The emphasis on the need for better alternatives and the critique of the superficial review process indicate a strong opposition to the current state of the project planning and execution.

What I want to say is that at the end of the day after all the decisions of all this respectable audience, we are left with the turbines and we see them every day and we have to make sure that our settlement does not die and Shani Livna. The entrepreneurs, by the way, didn't pay enough attention either. I want to show you the only place in Israel where there are people 1000 meters away from turbines, who suffer from much smaller turbines than what we are going to see and I want to address the general question in the meantime while the screen warms up. Science takes a lot longer to understand the public's complaints and the public itself also takes time to understand the harm, and what you will see here are not people who are quarrelsome, very simple people, let's watch this film and then we will understand what these things mean in a small way, just from what is happening in the settlement At most it is downwind at a distance of 1000 meters from the Gilboa. We don't have sound? But there are subtitles here, so you will see it shortly, it's a shame you won't hear the turbines, but again seventy meter turbines not 180 meters. There are no subtitles, what they say is that they came to the settlement and lived here for seven years and only a year ago they, in the sense of a randomized trial, started to see the turbines, which creates a before and after situation here. In fact, one day the residents woke up and discovered that these turbines were very disturbing - 
You can somehow get used to the visibility, the big problem is that these turbines, at least in the area of ​​audible noise, bother them, you can no longer go out on the balcony, you can no longer sit quietly, at night you have to sleep with the windows closed, people are starting to complain about sleeping problems, and that's just the end of it of what residents around the world complain about - regarding the turbines, they say we came and accepted this place and accepted the turbines, we even participated perhaps with the participation of the public, we did not understand the meaning. Today we understand that the meaning is that we cannot sell our houses, we cannot live in this settlement, with the quality of life we ​​wanted to live in, because we came to live in a place without city noise and today we actually ask to stop and here he says, we are actually fighting Don Quixote's wars with wind turbines, Because there are forces much greater than us.

We thought that a new and up-to-date TAMA was coming out with the green organizations, the business progressed.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Environmental organizations,"I would like to give some kind of background, first of all, in terms of the winged animals in the Yatir forest, and then also refer to the survey of the winged animals with specific comments. So, first of all, as you can see in the sensitivity map prepared by RTG, the entire area of ​​Yatir Forest is actually under the purple square where beyond the green line this purple square indicates the highest sensitivity and every area of ​​Yatir Forest is colored orange in the classification of high sensitivity to winged animals. The committee that created this sensitivity layer specifically took about sixty species that are particularly sensitive to turbines, mainly birds of prey. They gave each of them a rating and of course with academic support and in the end there is a layer that is specific about turbines and we see that every Yatir forest area is highly sensitive in terms of birds of prey In short, I have three slides, no more, we are talking about at least 165 species of birds that have been observed in the Yatir forest, some of them are rare birds, birds in danger of extinction globally, I am only talking about a number of examples. A bird that is there in the winter season, we are talking about a golden eagle, a species that is in serious danger of extinction from our country's landscapes. We are talking about a biblical eagle whose population is dwindling. We are also talking about a desert womb, these species are on the verge of extinction without the turbines , the turbines will be exactly the straw that breaks the back of this womb wing. These large species are particularly sensitive to turbines, they fly slowly, their maneuverability is low, many times the turbines turn slowly, they don't even realize that this turbine is about to hit them, they hover in the area of ​​the turbine, taking advantage of the wind that the turbine is also taking advantage of. Turn around and then give a light blow to the wing as someone once said and that's the end of it. A hawk eagle that we have a few pairs left that nest in Israel, it is a species of Ron Sdots Min that is sensitive on a world level and is here during the migration seasons and a little in the winter as well. No, no, but I'm talking about observations, all of these species, all the species that are here were observed in the Yatir forest, some of them in the survey of winged animals. I'm talking about the cliff gauge and here is the last species in my opinion on the list here which is the common shrew, also a species that is in our red book, all of them have been observed in the Yatir forest and may be harmed by these turbines. Beyond these winged animals at risk is a Yatir apricot forest and this was also presented in the report of the developers, a roosting site for birds of prey during the migration seasons, flocks of egrets and storks were observed there, as soon as you talk about a roosting site, you are talking about a very sensitive point, during roosting before roost And in the evening hours and after sleeping, in the morning, these raptors hover at a low altitude above the forest in search - please, this is my next slide, notes for the survey of the winged, carried out by the entrepreneurs. So first of all, I refer to the spring survey, in the fall survey, of course, it is all about one observation post, yes, one observation post was activated during all the surveys, but in the fall, three observers changed at this observation post. In the spring survey, they employed one person who worked throughout the spring, seven days a week, I'm not talking about the law on working hours and rest, that's not our concern here. But whoever thinks that a human being can count birds seven days a week, for an entire spring, in an efficient way, is simply wrong and misleading and this is also evident in the numbers, you saw the numbers that were presented here, 200,000 birds in the fall and that's thirty birds in the spring and all of them or I don't remember the number, no Thirty, I don't remember the exact number, but it's significantly lower and they're all at a low altitude and awfully close to the turbines, why? Because the man was already a Tortlan, he can't see anything, how is that possible? This spring survey was carried out carelessly. In our opinion, the spring survey cannot be relied upon, it should be repeated and done in a professional and proper manner. The whole issue of risk assessment in their report, it has arithmetic errors of two plus two equals three. Right at this level, and there are also assumptions that can be debated. I will soon present here an estimated table of the quantities of birds based on the radar data. This was also stated in the reference of RTG of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, it seems biased and wrong. The radar saw far too few birds there when you compare it to how many the observers saw. I say that the analysis of the radar data was performed incorrectly, wrongly, and I want to point out that we requested the raw data of the entrepreneurial radar several times and did not receive cooperation It is true that I am coming to the third slide, it is before the last, but there is a final point here, a survey of bat activity at height, as far as we understand from reading the material, and again bats are not in my area of ​​expertise, but from what I understand, a survey of bats at height is required and was not carried out, it was only carried out on the ground And of course what is relevant to the turbines is bats at altitude. Last slide, is the damage significant and I think this is the significant question that this committee is asking itself, so this table presents the data, the reference according to the data provided by the developers, it is divided into two rows, the number of bird species per turbine per year In the first column you see the threshold values ​​accepted for turbines, which were also discussed in the inter-ministerial committee, but this is not the standard. They are talking about 14 species per turbine and 0.2 species per turbine, yes Without touching their wrong numbers in my opinion, they talk about 11 birds per turbine, of all bird species, and if we do a simple analysis of the large birds out of these 11, we are talking about five large birds, which pretty much coincides with the number of birds per turbine per year, which is 25 times the requested threshold value. If you take our estimates and we did, we indicate here two numbers, one is based on their lenient assumptions and two if we take stricter assumptions, then we are already talking about ten and thirteen birds per turbine per year",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the environmental impact assessments related to a wind turbine project, particularly focusing on avian and bat populations. They criticize the methodology of the spring survey, highlight arithmetic errors in risk assessments, and question the analysis of radar data which they claim underestimates bird sightings compared to observer reports. Additionally, the speaker points out a lack of cooperation in obtaining raw data and the absence of necessary high-altitude bat activity surveys. They also challenge the thresholds and standards used by the developers, suggesting that the actual impact on bird species per turbine is significantly higher than reported and exceeds acceptable values.

Because the jitter is much bigger than what they show and then they tell us, what seven minutes we exceeded, now we exceeded, at first it won't be, now it's seven minutes we exceeded, but it's seven minutes according to what? They bring us Germany, in Germany there are three months of sunshine a year, in Israel there are nine months of sunshine a year. Nine months means a lot more sunrises, a lot more sunrises means a lot more shaking, now they tell us what the problem is, we'll put up curtains for you, curtains don't help my child who has to get up at six in the morning and my friend who has to get up at half past five when he gets it into the house. Shut up, live in graves, seal yourselves and everything is fine. So here too they lied, they really lied, because the second time they told me what you want, with Alik when I spoke, he told me acoustically. I tell him listen, laboratories in Germany that you bring the things, they say in a real acoustic test that in a quiet area, when there is no background noise, the noise of the decibels for those who live there increases, the feeling is much higher than 55 decibels and above. 55 decibels or higher, when people arrive and come to Mount Amsha when they are in front of me, a car drives in, I can already hear__ the noise at night and they claim that at night it is forty, so what did we exceed by three, forty-three decibels, so we exceeded a little. 55 decibels and above harms my health",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the wind turbine project, focusing on the negative impacts it will have on the local community and environment. They mention issues such as financial disagreements, potential harm to local settlements due to reduced attractiveness for new residents, and health concerns related to noise and vibrations from the turbines. The speaker also accuses the project developers of lying and disregarding the well-being of local residents for financial gain. There is a clear emphasis on the inadequacy of the measures proposed to mitigate these impacts and a distrust in the information provided by the developers.

I'll be brief, the first point I want to say is that for every question we were asked, we gave full clarifications, not once, not twice but three times, furthermore, some of the clarifications were given both orally and in writing, everything is qualified, almost all the comments that were made, we did not receive Until now we have not seen, we have not found, we have not understood, every question that was asked was answered and every question that was not asked, and when we raised it and presented the question of whether there is a problem here they said there is no problem. All of a sudden it turns out that there is something unclear in the summary model. The data of the summary model was lying on the table of the relevant organizations from August 15 and from August 15 every data --- was received, including all the survey data, including all the zip codes and the questions asked. Including clarifications and including references, etc. and I will refer to it. Regarding the issue of the data not matching up, because this is actually the problem, the Bitir radar found that not many birds pass by at the height of the turbines. We are the answer of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and to a certain extent also of RTG, based on two data. One figure is about a survey from 1991 that allegedly found 850,000 birds that passed below 250 meters in the Arabah, the figure does not exist. It does not exist in any of the publications related to this survey that was carried out. I called Switzerland yesterday, in order to get the data, my Swiss is not bad, but I forgot that they don't work on Sundays. The data arrived in a very convenient way to the point where it would be impossible to figure things out. There is no such figure as the figure provided in Oded's documents and it seems to me that RTG's simply does not exist either. Please, when I look at RTG's data this morning it says not a figure but based on a very rough estimate, they must have played with the numbers a bit. As for us, the second figure that we are supposed to rely on is 2016, over a million passed, on which it is a figure from the Galilee, the figure in the Galilee they claim that in the surroundings in 2015 there were birds up to 200 meters high, we asked for this data, the message was that we cannot pass it on to you. The main point, you can't rely on a figure that you can't rely on. Now the point is very simple, the data does not coincide with what RTG and what the environmental protection want.",0,0,0,1,1,Support,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement appears to be opposing the wind turbine project.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Locals,": Attorney Matan Garfunkel, representing Har Amsha, in short, beyond the unfortunately serious problems raised here in connection with the review and the survey of the wingmen, we would like to point out two additional main issues that were not examined at all in the review, in our opinion they should be examined there. As a matter of principle, I will go ahead and say that the settlements' position is of course against this plan - so after saying what I said, let's briefly go into the substance of things. In our opinion, the review did not refer to two important issues that the gentleman spoke about earlier about the methodology, etc. and this is the time to put the emphasis on them and not further down the road. First of all, in short, there are two things, the first thing that the review did not refer to, it did not refer in detail to the relevant distances from the blue line of the plan, it was done in a very lax way in completing the review. So I'll go ahead and say, as the committee surely knows, something like a month, a month and a half ago, the Ministry of Health issued new guidelines that probably may have been refined later regarding the recommended ranges from the turbines. Now this matter has two main parts, the first part, of course, such and such health effects, which may occur as a result of such and such distances of turbines from houses and industrial buildings. It's one thing, another thing. These guidelines were eventually perfected into one or another binding directive and such and such ranges were set. This means that these ranges will limit the settlement's ability to expand in two ways, the first within the approved blue line according to the currently approved plans, that in practice the situation is that not all the planning potential has been realized within the settlement and it will be possible to build in the foreseeable future additional buildings that may suddenly find themselves within ranges - Second, the second thing is damage to the settlement potential of the settlement, according to TMA 35 this settlement can reach the size of 350 families now in order to reach the same number of 350 families which is something that appears in a national outline plan and will happen in the future, I mean it is not a thing Ertilai, they will have to plan and approve a plan outside of the existing blue line. This is one thing, too. I don't think the review addressed the essential issue of the health effects on the residents of Mount Amsha and the other settlements We are at the stage of objections, this is exactly the stage, the review should include all the relevant environmental and health effects. The fact is that the review was done before the deposit and the health issue, and here I want to say something very important He has experience. This is a new matter and there is nothing wrong with that, that the health effects regarding it, certainly in Israel, are not sufficiently known. We believe that this matter should be examined in depth at this stage and ask the esteemed committee to guide whether it is the representative of the Minister of Health, whether it is the representative of the environment, to guide and allow to examine this issue. And after the committee receives the information on the health issue, we are talking about the consequences of noise, balance problems, mental stress, concentration problems and such and such matters, after you ask the relevant professional parties to cross-check the information with them, then we will move forward with planning procedures. But now we ask to stop, this issue is just as important as the damage to the landscape and the other issues that were raised",0,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses several concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly focusing on the health effects on residents due to the proximity of turbines to houses and industrial buildings. They highlight that the current guidelines may restrict the expansion of local settlements and that the potential health impacts have not been sufficiently addressed or known, especially in the context of Israel. The speaker calls for a deeper examination of these health effects by relevant authorities before proceeding with the project and suggests halting the planning procedures until these issues are resolved. This indicates a clear opposition to the project as it stands, due to concerns about health impacts, inadequate assessments, and potential negative effects on local development and residents' well-being.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Government,"Let me say maybe how I understood your request. There are issues that are environmental issues with which there is a problem and there are issues that are issues that we do not agree with the way it was measured or presented, I will make a separation between the two things but we must remember the two things otherwise what we gathered for, not just to find the technical failures. Well, on Saturday night we passed our joint opinion, both on the subject of the environmental impact survey and the winged survey. I would like to start by saying that the Ministry sees great importance in the development of renewable energies and there is no doubt that this program will definitely advance this issue in a very significant way. She has an important place. On the other hand, we examine each plan individually, to see what the other side of the scales is, what is actually the harm that is expected and to see that along the way we do not approve one thing to solve one problem, we do not create another problem or harm the residents, harm the environment with other things. I will go through the opinion, it is detailed, includes 18 pages. I will not read everything and I will not give a speech, I will try to focus on the most significant points in the order of the opinions. In terms of background uses, since it is not explicitly stated here, we are talking about sensitive land uses that are not currently within the borders of the blue line, that is, there are no sensitive uses within the blue line. In contrast, near the blue line there are several sensitive uses and it is important that the members of the committee hear them. One - the residences and public buildings of Mount Amsha are 580 meters from the turbine, five hundred and eighty, this is what is written in the survey 580 meters, residences and public buildings 800 meters second, residences and public buildings in the Yehuda Citadel 790 meters, in total these are relatively short distances. The Ein Koryot Reserve, which is also very, very close by, is located 135 meters away. This matters because the environmental effects apply to the Teva Nature Reserve. Almost all the effects that apply to humans, they also apply in one way or another to animals, plants, etc. In terms of noise, the issue here has been presented, all in all we receive the test that carried out both the methodology and the results. According to what was presented today, an abnormality in the existing receptors in these values ​​is not expected here, in terms of the issue of infra sound, we and the Ministry of Health issued a policy, this is not a regulation, it is a joint policy for this issue and Eli Kobi presented it at the end. which stands at 75 decibels, sorry, at the moment, according to the documents that have been forwarded to us to date, there is no estimate or DGB, sorry, proof that this program meets this criterion, it is something that must be completed and this is how Ofri directed it. Then they will be able to detail what it is, NRO, in terms of our recommendations on the issue of noise, there is a situation called we need to define what it is, it is quiet operation of the turbines, to prevent even getting close to the standard is something that is not recommended. We need to determine, we ask that positions and regulations be established regarding the construction work, to anchor the existing criterion of course and to see that there will be compliance with the criterion in operation and of course in this matter we will ask for long-term monitoring to see that the plan that will be decided upon for the deposit that things do not deviate and a mechanism for what happens if there are deviations from the standard to complete this topic. From the point of view of jitter, we don't really have a set standard and all in all the reference in the review is a reference that is acceptable to us, except for one fact, in the review they performed some kind of calculation which is a raw calculation for jitter and then from it they made some kind of filter for the morning and evening hours on the assumption that people are inside the houses and are asleep, etc. ', this thing is very, very unacceptable to us, we think that it is not a correct way to check it, we think that it should be made worse and maintained - the meaning is to measure the shaking over hours, the model refers to over certain hours, now they came and said people in beds, so why Measure tremors during the hours when people are in bed? At half past five in the evening, at six in the morning, etc., this is how it is explained in the review, the deduction is not acceptable to us and if the deduction is lowered we see that we do not meet the standard, the standard they presented

Undoubtedly the most significant impact will be on the settlement of Har Amsha, from wherever they leave the settlement, from every house they leave, from every point, from every garden, the view they will see will be a view of wind turbines. Just to give an order of magnitude for the height, we are talking about 180 meters, 180 meters in terms of order of magnitude, this is Azrieli's structure, the round one, okay? Have a scale, this structure will be 180 meters round, now you have to understand that this thing is not still, the top height of the blade reaches 180 meters and what is important here is that this thing is not a still thing that stands but something that moves and the scenic effect of a thing that moves Dynamic is much higher. In terms of - we think there is no escape and if you want to reduce this damage significantly, you have to think about both layout changes and changes in the height of the turbines. We think that the damage here is extreme. In terms of ecology and open spaces, this area is relatively less sensitive compared to the neighboring areas of schools, etc., but it also serves as a transition area, a food improvement area in the forest that functions as a system in itself. We have no ability to really know what the specific impact is on animals and quantify it, we need to understand that without a doubt there is going to be damage and a significant decrease in the activity of the animals in this area. There is an issue here with a species called two-generation cob, which is found in one of the turbines, our recommendation in this business is to make a conservation plan here",0,0,0,1,0,Weakly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the wind turbine project, focusing on its impact on local residents and the environment. They criticize the methods used to assess the impact of vibrations (jitter) on residents, suggesting that the assessments underestimate the true impact by not measuring during critical times when people are at home. Additionally, the speaker highlights the visual impact of the turbines, comparing their height to a well-known building and emphasizing the negative scenic effect due to their movement. Concerns are also raised about the ecological impact, particularly on local wildlife and habitats, with a call for a conservation plan to mitigate these effects.

03/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Government,"I will say in a very short sentence, first of all just what you said, no regulations were issued by the Ministry of Health, a position paper was issued, and I will read two very clear sentences from it. In plans where the turbines are spaced between five hundred and a thousand meters apart, which is the case before us, it will be required to examine the issue of noise but not the issue of vibration, and in plans where the turbines will be located above 1000 meters from residences, there is no recommendation to require an examination of the issue of noise, the low noise will not exceed 75 during the night, within The residential building. DGB Now for the matter itself, there is no experience in Israel, the position of the Ministry of Health written by doctors one of them is an expert in environmental epidemiology, is based on studies, there are not many studies in the world, not long term they are also very contradictory. It is true that studies have found such and such health effects, that is true, we are not saying that there are no effects at all or anything like that. There are, but they are examined regarding the distance and proximity between uses that are sensitive to turbines and other conditions that exist. Now, as far as we know according to the review, the turbines are more than 500 meters away - the review as we know took approved plans and plans that are in the deposit stages. If for settlements, if not, then it's wrong. If the settlement has a plan that is already in deposit or nearing approval or anything like that that is approaching, approaching more than 500 meters, then this matter should be addressed. But according to what they wrote in the review, correct me if I'm wrong, they don't approach beyond 500, so that's the position of the Ministry of Health. On a very practical level, they should bring the position paper they wrote last night and we will be able to refer to it, if they claim that there is a plan that is nearing approval and it is approaching beyond 500, then the review is wrong, this is what I have. If there was a danger, then we would have opposed it, we didn't. Look, the ministry's work was done in this area, which included several experts in public health, and it was done in a situation where there is no experience, there are almost no turbines in Israel, and it is based on studies and facts that there are so-called doings in the world. In the world the distances vary between four hundred and three thousand meters, depending on where we are, whether it is Australia or another country. And in Israel the situation is a little different anyway above a distance of 500 meters which according to what we saw in the survey they stand at this distance, the effect on health is much smaller. That means the chance that they will meet what is needed increases at this distance. What bothers me is that he said in the discussion that they have an approved plan that is less than 500 meters away and we didn't see it in the survey, the survey didn't-  

So as long as this 500 is kept then of course they have to complete the document. I also didn't like that they avoided this part of the jitters, it's not convenient for them to deal with it, they gave, as Oded said, all kinds of instructions that are not exactly suitable for the review and you still need to exhaust the . This subject even though it is more than 500",1,0,0,1,0,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be cautiously supportive of the wind turbine project, contingent on adherence to specific guidelines regarding the distance of turbines from sensitive areas. The speaker acknowledges the health effects associated with wind turbines but emphasizes that these effects are manageable if turbines are placed more than 500 meters away from settlements, as per the guidelines reviewed. The speaker also indicates a willingness to address any discrepancies in the review concerning turbine placement relative to settlements. The mention of the Ministry of Health's position and the reference to international standards further suggest a support stance that is based on compliance with established health and safety guidelines.

The wind turbine project in the Yatir Forest is a joint project for the settlements of South Mount Hebron, Carmel, Ma'on and Beit Yatir, they own the land, cultivate the land and Enlight Oiram company. This project has been promoted in recent years and we are at a very advanced stage that the environmental tests have been completed, and we will present the things to you. Just before I dive into presenting the project in just two words, two slides about the field. This field is one of tremendous growth in the world, wind energy throughout the developed world is growing at tremendous rates. Just in the last year, sixty gigawatts of wind turbines were installed, we are talking about a rate of two power turbines, on the order of the turbines that are installed in Tir every hour that are installed in the world. We will hear here the achievements that exist, but compared to the scope of installation that this field is experiencing, to the growth and technological growth and efficiency, we are talking about tremendous rates. In the end, as Honorable Chairman Petah said, we are talking about a field whose role is one, to bring about a better world free of emissions, to reduce the whole issue of emissions from fossil means of production and ultimately also to save morbidity and mortality. This is the meaning of such a power plant. The planned project in Bitir includes 13 turbines with a maximum height of 180 meters, a wind turbine built from a mast and blades. The length of the height of the mast is 120 meters and each blade is 60 meters long, so you actually reach a side height of 180 meters. Each turbine has an installed capacity of over three megawatts and such a power plant, with its minimal footprint, actually produces electricity that supplies approximately 17,000 households. We are talking about a power plant of this magnitude, which will generate electricity for something like half of the city of Ashkelon. A unique issue that is important for me to emphasize, before I pass the baton to Barak and he will describe the findings of the review, this plan is entirely based on distribution lines, it will actually be fed from the Arad substation, the power lines to the Tel Arad junction will be thickened and the Tel Arad junction according to the feasibility of the plan is Also holds a conditional license from the Electricity Authority, actually lines will go up to the underground Yatir forest, of course. The project is located on the northeastern edge of the Yatir forest, the green spot we are in, it is located on the edge of the forest, on the southern slopes of Mount Hebron. , all the turbines are located on the edge of cultivated agricultural areas and another issue that is important to emphasize with regard to this project is that it is all based on existing roads.

In this context, one of the things that came up was the topic of the whistleblower or the way in which it is appropriate to analyze the surveys of winged birds, here the debate is more difficult because the very collection or the very method of analysis is being debated and there will be no escape from a professional discussion to try to bridge this, but also the proposal of RTG and this was mentioned here, so it is important to note that, they put forward the proposal that they actually specified threshold values.

For those who have a wing, who are of course affected by air quality from air pollution and also because there is no ability at the moment to understand these data, what they mean, which projects pass these thresholds, which do not, what does this mean, will these thresholds at all allow us to meet the goals set by the state or No. There is also some kind of discrimination here between all kinds of other projects that harm winged animals or other animals and do not receive this all-too-expressive, quantitative reference, and therefore the tendency at the moment in terms of the planning administration is not to accept this method and continue or to accept the qualitative assessment rather than the quantitative adherence This to the threshold of four regarding jitter, I will just draw your attention to what you mentioned earlier, the document above 500 meters said there is no effect of jitter and it is written in the document - above five hundred, it is written - and despite what was presented --- there is no standard, two more comments , one, I think the issue of recreation and leisure, I think there is some kind of excessive concern here, like people who sit in Yarkon Park on picnics under flickering power lines, I don't think so - last point, last and I leave, this issue of the activation phase, we are today in the planning administration We are promoting a move that will soon be here, the whole issue of conventional power plants, the whole issue of instructions set out in the plans, in this case conventional power plants, for the operating phase, today the Ministry of Environmental Protection has a series of regulatory tools to deal with it in a much better and correct way. If it is today, there is the emission permit, conditions in the business license, etc. This is the place and it is the best method to determine everything that is required for the activation phase, with more correct and updated mechanisms. Now there is also in your proposal, during this process we are working in full cooperation with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, on the other hand in the proposals you have also read here from the opinion, there are many things here that you are actually asking to determine that instructions in the plan for the operating phase. Now we are together with Menachem Zalotsky, together with my son and other people in the office, we want them to formulate some kind of template, some kind of generic document that will detail all the instructions",0,0,0,1,1,Support,0,"The speaker in the statement appears to be discussing various aspects of environmental impact assessments and regulatory processes related to a project, likely involving wind turbines. They mention concerns about air quality and the impact on winged animals, questioning the adequacy of current thresholds and whether they meet state goals. The speaker also contrasts the treatment of this project with other projects that affect animals, suggesting a discrepancy in how they are assessed. Additionally, they discuss the operational phase of power plants and emphasize working in cooperation with the Ministry of Environmental Protection to implement better regulatory tools. The overall tone suggests a critical view of current assessment methods but also indicates involvement in improving these processes.

The speaker seems to be involved in planning or regulatory processes and is focused on refining and questioning current methods rather than outright opposing or supporting the project. They express concerns about the adequacy of current environmental assessments but also discuss efforts to improve these assessments and regulatory mechanisms. This indicates a nuanced position that leans towards seeking improvements in how projects are evaluated and managed rather than a clear support or opposition stance.

I think the government's goals are very clear, you are very senior partners in a considerable part of them, --- renewable energy We think that the wind turbines have a very significant layer also in relation to the balance and management of the solar energy system. Unfortunately, there are not many places that are suitable for wind energy, because unlike solar, which is suitable for much larger areas, not everywhere has wind. These places really are in tweezers. Of course there are security constraints, Shahar here, but which very, very limit the possibility of the wind turbines to exist beyond the fact that they have not progressed where there is wind. There are planning constraints, there are very considerable environmental constraints, so I think that if there is a place that is needed and it is possible to erect the wind turbines, we need to find a way to promote it. Government goals are not just slogans that are said at the UN, they have a price. No one hides it, wind turbines and renewable energies also have a price. If it is scenic aspects, if it is a very large land division of the solar. But you also have to always remember to keep in mind Well, what is the alternative? These are not questions that precede alternatives of conventional power plants, but we want what can be achieved in renewable energy.

Now, a lot of things have come up here, which are really scary. But you have to know how to differentiate between the facts and the demonization. Because at the end of the day to come and say wind turbines is a beautiful or ugly thing, it's a matter of world view. To come and say that tourism in the forest is a good or bad thing, there are those who are afraid to see tourists in the forest and there are those like us who want to see tourists in the forest and are also willing to sacrifice their plantations so that tourists and people will come to the Yatir forest. It's very easy to pull out and say cynicism, but we also live in it, since we went up to the Yatir Forest, Amos Shagiv, Ron Shechner, Yaakov Ben Dov who is not here, and I, for thirty-five years have been trying to promote the wind energy from measurements and tests we did and the Yatir Forest on our agricultural lands, For a moment we never imagined that anyone who speaks for green, especially environmental organizations of all kinds, would not lie on the fence to help pass this plan in the most correct and most appropriate way.

26/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Developers,"Hello everyone, my name is Gilad Yeavetz, the CEO of Enlight, an entrepreneurial company in the project, together with the settlements of Carmel, Ma'on and Beit Yatir. Following the request of the chairman of the committee, what I propose is that I present the project and the plan in summary and I will refer mainly to the points that came up in the previous two or three discussions in which The full memorandum has already been presented, there may also be a request to go over points in the memorandum, of course we will be required. Let's start, I am talking about a plan to establish a wind farm to produce electricity free of emissions, with a capacity of up to 42 megawatts. We are promoting the plan together with the three settlements Since 2011, when the settlements have been promoting it for several years before that as a joint venture in which the project is actually held by a joint decision with the settlements. Israel's history on an international treaty, there is a commitment to reduce emissions and a work plan to establish renewable energy, including wind energy as one of the main pillars of the plan. In addition, this plan will contribute to the strengthening of the agricultural settlement in Mount Hebron and in the overall summary the plan will have very great benefits for the environment and health for the economy and we will represent That in a nutshell. In terms of the location of the project in the area, we are talking about the north-eastern side on the agricultural areas of Yatir Forest. At a certain distance a little east of Mitra settlements and even further east of Beer Sheva is the general location. If you look at the specific area of ​​the turbines zoom in, we actually see the layout of the turbines when the nearest settlements are Har Amsha, Beit Yatir and Shani Livna. As mentioned, the turbines themselves are in agricultural areas when they are on the edge of the forest to the northeast. A few words about the advantages of wind energy, the biggest advantage compared to other sources of renewable energy we are talking about full dual use of land. That is, if in TMA / 10 / d / 10 solar they directed the entrepreneurs and gave very large incentives for installations on roofs and water reservoirs, in fact with wind energy we achieve this in an inherent way, when we can install the turbines on the edge of the agricultural land and allow it to 99% of the rest of the area Agricultural growth is a very significant thing in the aspect of the continuation of agricultural settlement and in the aspect of the open areas. We are talking about a very big advantage looking at the graph on the left side of the completion of solar production renewable. This thing is only possible by a mix of renewable energies, how they complement each other and this thing lowers the cost of a huge amount of backup that is required by conventional energy if there is no backup between different renewable energies that produce at different times Speaking of large land savings, I was talking about the very layout of the turbines. In addition, wind turbines are also significantly more efficient than solar energy. This means that the government's goals can be reached with much lower power than if it is based only on solar energy. The wind turbines also do not consume water, this is a big advantage in the State of Israel. Solar energy, as strange as it sounds, consumes quite a lot of water in the process of cleaning the panels, which is required for this project. It stabilizes the electricity grid in the area, it will bring an important electricity grid to the area and it will bring it under control. That is, we are talking about the entire area of ​​the turbines and several kilometers to the south, there will be an underground network lying, very environmental, which will also contribute in this matter both scenically and environmentally and in terms of protecting winged animals. And it is very important to say two more things, this is a very technology at a stage that exists on a huge scale in the world, all the aspects that are examined including in our review, including the discussions of this committee were examined in the most advanced countries and continue to be installed on very large scales. The last thing, the State of Israel is a country with security dangers as well, there is a very big advantage to decentralizing the electricity network and producing it from many decentralized places. Not to rely on just one gas line, a hit to which would put us all in the dark or a cyber attack on it or anything that exists and happened recently in many countries in the world. A few words about the application of renewable energy in the world and in Israel, we are already talking about a huge installation volume of 800,000 megawatts in the world, sixty percent of which is wind energy, 480,000 in recent years in the European Union alone, this is a picture that also exists in other parts of the world, we are talking about 86% of the total installations Of all the power plants including coal and gas nuclear plants, 86% of that comes from renewable energy, of which 51% of the total ie including nuclear, gas and coal reactors comes from wind energy. It actually becomes the main means of utilizing electricity in the advanced world and not only in the advanced world. In recent years they have built two turbines, two turbines every hour, 48 turbines a day in China, and in the United States there is a huge scale. We are talking about tens of percent of the grid of the advanced countries. In Israel we are talking about a huge underproduction, 27 megawatts of which a considerable part was established twenty-five years ago in the Golan Heights, this is in total - - we are talking less than 0.1%
- Regarding considerations for the layout of the turbines, the original plan was with a larger amount of turbines, as of today, 13 turbines are presented for deposit as far as we are concerned. I will soon present the caveat of the Ministry of Defense. When one of the planning considerations from our point of view was the use of existing agricultural roads, their thickening which would only improve them and the accessibility of the residents but not the breaking of new roads and in addition we actually placed the turbines at the edges of the agricultural areas, which would allow full dual use of the land and in addition there was a very great emphasis on The preservation of the trees in the forest, I will soon introduce, in fact there is no damage to trees in the forest at all in the program, I will soon introduce this thing. Of course, from our point of view, the preferred alternative is to establish the project with these turbines, since there is opposition from the army, the committee will decide on a deposit without the green section of the blue line, all Mr. That way we will also give up the entire section and the access road to its name, so the project can definitely be approved without this part.",1,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They emphasize the significant global and regional adoption of wind energy, highlighting its importance in the renewable energy sector and its substantial contribution to electricity generation in advanced countries. The speaker also discusses the careful planning of the turbine layout to minimize environmental impact, such as using existing agricultural roads and preserving trees. Furthermore, they mention a specific modification to the project plan to address opposition from the army, suggesting a willingness to adapt the project to ensure its approval.

I think that this plan is not ripe for submission and it is true that with the help of the IDF there is luck that there really is an IDF not only to protect the State of Israel, but also to protect the health of the people. So, although with the help of the IDF, three turbines were brought down that are closer to Mount Amsha, but I think it is still not enough. We are not the only ones in this struggle, there is also the Mashgav Shashavin Regional Council and the council together with the council - in the north entered into a very intense and serious struggle regarding the turbines and the sacrifice of the wind turbines for the settlements. I think that the health issue and the impact on the residents have not been examined to the end and I think this matter should be given a little bigger magnifying glass how it will affect the residents. In my opinion I did not answer the larger extension of Mount Amsha, on the full blue line of Mount Amsha and just to give you an earful, you also said that Mount Amsha is a settlement that has been in the making for so many years, so today it is perhaps the most developing settlement, the existing settlement is already with 50 families, there are families on the way. In the next expansion, another 50 families and we will eventually reach the settlement This is for 200 families. As I said, there is a great demand to settle on the mountain, there are also plans for other settlements, I am of course connected not only to the health issue but also to the scenic issue This one looks like they are actually cutting down the forest and erecting perhaps one of the largest wind turbines in the State of Israel. For the turbines in my opinion, correct me if I'm wrong, but the biggest ones that have been built to date, right? To this day there are no such turbines. No, there is not in the Golan, there is in Gilboa, in Gilboa there is a farm of turbines which are much smaller turbines, not powerful and huge turbines like the ones that are supposed to be built here and on the scenic level it injures the only forest here in the south, it is not, it seems to me something imaginary. I mean, how can such a thing pass quietly. So it is true that you are talking about health, health, the health of those who do not live in the vicinity, the health of those who absorb the existing energies like in Hadera and the center, but we are also talking here about the health of those who live in the vicinity and this should be treated with reverence.

First of all, I gave you an opportunity. I will give you an opportunity today to express yourself, to the residents, representatives of settlements in the area, etc. What they have and I also want to mention that we are not discussing this program for the first time. This is a very, very important program on both sides, both in terms of alternative energy and in terms of the residents who live there. And by the way, every alternative energy plan is somewhere on land and has neighbors and there are residents and there are open areas, there are always considerations here and there. Whatever I will ask, I know there are many people who would like to talk. We will be able to speak to the representatives of the settlements, of course to the promoters of the program, I ask that there be an orderly discussion according to permission to speak, without outbursts, even though this issue is important to you and sensitive. And let's conduct a properly organized discussion so that we can reach decisions, meaning that if you take them down then the next turbine is no longer within the 500 meter radius, not right now. : What will be the production capacity. I will try to balance the speakers between the two language approaches, please Professor Micah, I just ask that you please comment, I just can't understand, apparently I've still been here for a year and a half and I'm still considered new. Can't understand if we've been talking for at least nine months that I've known about this bird survey, why not - why are there things that haven't reached them and you - what's missing, Oded you can only mention factually I want to understand. But Assaf, we had a discussion in the committee in March and since then there was another discussion, I haven't seen - since then I haven't seen your letter saying that we didn't receive one of the things I liked about the discussion is that they said it should take more time, it's like, like until now we've done it within A month or two like this. It may be so, I suggest that we accept, I suggest that when we make the decision we take into account that it may harm several tens of families, maybe even hundreds that can come to the area. No, to make a decision you have to take the worst draft from the point of view that it can hurt and is it important enough. By the way, I think so, but it should be taken into account. : I want to say a few things, they quoted from a letter from the Director General for Environmental Protection, I don't remember to whom, so the only one who read the fine print is me. We have the same conclusion, but I accept Ali's conclusion, we should not make it easy on ourselves, it may and probably will harm the expansion of two settlements. The truth must be told, it will harm the expansion of the two settlements and the role of this committee - let's not make it easy on ourselves , it can harm the expansion of - one has to weigh one against the other, this issue saves human lives, the issue of reducing the use of coal and switching to alternative energy, I don't know if it saves ten or seven hundred, what I said there, is something that is very, very important for the The general public. It may be considered that it is not in the direction of the turbines, wrong, so I am making it difficult on purpose, so as not to say it is good in all respects. But I think that our responsibility and the worst thing I hear here is let's wait a little longer, Let's check one more thing. You can always improve the data and the decisions and all that. But the meaning of time is also the meaning that more time people will breathe coal, more time there will be air pollution and more people will die and get sick, I don't want to be a demagogue, but I don't I have no weight here and therefore I think that among the benefits of power energy that Israel does not succeed at all in getting close to the goals in the Ministry of Environmental Protection, we pushed for the government to make decisions, and these decisions are in the spirit, to use the expression. But at least we are in our responsibility as the South, we will entrust this plan with conditions and hope that all conditions will be met and that it will move forward.",1,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project, despite acknowledging potential negative impacts. They recognize that the project could harm the expansion of two settlements and affect several families, but they emphasize the importance of transitioning from coal to alternative energy sources to save lives and reduce air pollution. The speaker also mentions the need to not delay the project further, as prolonging the decision-making process would continue to expose people to harmful coal emissions. They advocate for moving forward with the project under certain conditions, hoping that these will be met to ensure progress.

The speaker acknowledges the need to adhere to the Ministry of Health's guidelines and addresses concerns about avian impacts, but ultimately deems them reasonable and not a barrier to the project's progress. The comparison to other power plants and the mention of the project's location being ideal and far from major settlements further indicate a view that the project's benefits outweigh the concerns. The speaker also suggests flexibility in future settlement expansions, indicating a pragmatic approach to managing potential human impacts.

We had disagreements on several topics. In the end, we focused on several main topics. One is observations, the effects of facades, and the second topic is all the topics of audience absorption, and the third is the topic of --- let's actually start with the topic of fire safety. First of all, I must point out that, to my delight, the entrepreneurs took the issues we raised seriously to a professional body and prepared a professional report that deals with fire safety, we went over the report, we passed an orderly reference on Thursday. I will say briefly. The direction from our point of view is the right direction, at the same time there are some basic assumptions here that are not acceptable to us. A base assumption that relies on the report prepared by Zvika Avni regarding the level of risk from fire and the forest, in our opinion, is an underestimation and I have already detailed it in the previous meetings in addition - the level of risk from fire and the flammability of the forest. From our point of view, there are underestimations here. Another thing, it is part of the data that the report prepared by Mr. Meir Harel is regulations from abroad, some of the things are either speculations or dressing up standards from abroad that do not fit with what is written and known in Israel. Let's start with the subject of the flight restrictions, the flight restrictions came to Eliyahu in writing, from the aerial firefighting squadron. The report refers to the judgment of a single pilot during a fire and to us it seems speculative. B. It is impossible to prepare something like this on the level of the individual pilot, but to refer to the known written limitations as they came in writing, we attached it to our opinion, the second thing is an estimate regarding the amount of trees and again I am referring to 13 turbines not 10. An assessment of the amount of trees that will be damaged, what was presented here is incorrect, there is a written reference regarding safety and extinguishing a fire and forest, the standards we are required to meet are the same standards of buffer zones from settlements, that is, 20 meters --- forest, 56 meters thinning which is not a plateau they presented 50 A meter of exposure - that we have 90 dunams against the 12 dunams that appear in the developers' exposure. - Yes, it means cutting down about 4000 trees, and this is contrary to what was presented of 50. Now again, I say once again that these are data that need to be worked with, but you have to understand that these data are for us right now --- another thing, there is a very detailed safety plan that some of our recommendations are recommendations that are not They can be implemented, this or a number of volunteer teams, volunteer pre-military training for firefighting, or KKL-Junk will recruit more workers and thicken the firefighting system. Once again we claim that if this is the need, the entrepreneurs should bear this need. This will be part of the plan documents or a regulatory provision for a coordinated extinguishing order",0,0,0,1,1,Neutral,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly focusing on the underestimation of fire risks and the potential damage to the forest due to the project. They criticize the reliance on reports that they believe do not accurately reflect local conditions and standards, and they challenge the adequacy of the data presented by the developers, especially regarding the number of trees that would be affected. The speaker also emphasizes the need for more stringent safety measures and better coordination in firefighting efforts, suggesting that the developers should bear the costs of these enhancements. Overall, the speaker's focus on demanding more accurate assessments, questioning the compliance with local standards, and insisting on additional safety measures indicates opposition to the project as currently proposed.

26/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Locals,", First of all, every Finn who helped us in his time to build Mount Amsha and take it out of Baruch knows better than anyone else how difficult it was to get to this situation today. That we, God willing, are all full of residents on Mount Amsha, when at the time there were barely seven people on Mount Amsha, if we would have seen a human passing through Mount Amsha in broad daylight we would have blessed that we lived and existed, yes? So that's how it was for years. Today we are in a situation where we have a thriving settlement. I was a tour guide twenty years ago I came to this point in the forest, why, because I have not found a place in the State of Israel that was as beautiful as this pearl, between Mount Amsha and Shani. I many people came there and were amazed by this area. They want to turn this area, which is one of a kind, into an industrial area. And for this we are fighting with all our might, I have been fighting for this for eight years, of which five years I worked voluntarily as a secretary and member of the local committee, every day with the High Courts with legal proceedings, to reach this situation. Why destroy this pearl? Now it's one thing The second thing, I ride a bike every morning, I'm very grateful to the guys who care about the environment and green energy, I ride a bike, I haven't seen many guys from Beit Yatir ride a bike, I ride a bike every morning and I do competitions, and I see the The eagles above. I want someone to come and tell me here from the environment, is there a chance that I will see deer roaming around in this area of ​​Mount Amsha, two birches or jackals or foxes, because they will run away, you only referred to the birds, refer to these animals as well. It's one thing, another thing like the guys from--- I didn't even consult with them, even though we're talking to the guys from Shani Birba, but--- said something that I put in writing, so these things, these feelings, they come from both directions , of all the residents, they did not share with us, these documents that you are talking about, of the quality of the environment, of public health, etc., were not published on the Internet, David, I submitted a request to you, I ask that you address this request, in my opinion there is a fundamental flaw here. Here are the guidelines of the Planning Administration, which are here in my hand, they come and say these guidelines, one of the goals of Amendment 101 to the Planning and Construction Law, is to ensure the transparency of the planning procedures, for this we gave an order to come and publish the opinion and the documents on the Internet, please do it , how can we give you feedback, how can there be dialogue between the citizen and the administration if we do not receive these data if we do not see these documents. So please post them online, give us time to respond, give us time to come and make constructive comments. I have a letter here that I just received from the director of the energy sector of the European Union, what, he is ready to come here and speak to whoever wants to, from the government, from the district committee, he saw the situation in Mount Amsha, he saw the plans, he said you are going to make the mistakes that we We did twenty years ago. Please _______of you, avoid it, this area is too beautiful, he is ready to come and explain things to you. He wrote to me in the letter the subject of the proximity to the roads, I submitted another request to you David on this subject. All over the world there is a reference for the turbines at what distance they should be from the roads. You put turbines here along the entire length of the axis, the only escape we have to get out of Mount Amsha, we have no other axis, to bring our children to school, and this axis you put turbines for us, the turbines on Mount Amsha, those who don't live there don't know, but I live there and I lived there And I spent winters there, there is ice, there is snow on Mount Amsha, this ice will accumulate on pillars 180 meters high, as soon as these propellers are full of ice, they will come and start spinning, it will bombard the roads, it will bombard the whole area, it can reach distances of hundreds of meters, these blocks of ice, There will be accidents, guys, get the Ministry of Transport involved, I asked you I submitted an application this morning, get the Ministry of Transport involved, come and tell me Haim why are you submitting this now. Friends, you did not deceive us, we did not - -- your opinions. In all of Europe you have a minimal distance from roads, you have here one of the turbines that sits on road 80, which is the most axial road in the entire region. I end with one thing, I unfortunately --- very much with --- we don't want, we are tired, we are exhausted, we don't want legal proceedings, we don't want to fight with the guys from Beit Yatir, that I pray with you three times a day, they are friends mine i love them But they made mistakes in the past, I proved to them that they made mistakes in the past, I had to thwart two ventures they had, and not because I think they are wrong, they made mistakes, it's natural. Today I think they thank me for thwarting these ventures. Today I ask them to think twice, there are alternatives, maybe you don't see that this is your territory in the forest, take it, use your head, use your energies to find alternatives to this thing. This thing is not in the right place, this forest you developed it, you maintained it, you were the first, you deserve a lot of rights to this thing, but guys don't destroy what you have understood all your life, don't destroy it.",1,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the placement and potential hazards of wind turbines in Mount Amsha, particularly regarding safety issues related to ice accumulation and proximity to roads. The speaker references past mistakes with similar projects and urges reconsideration and exploration of alternatives, highlighting the need for involvement from the Ministry of Transport due to safety risks. The emphasis on the negative impacts on the community and the environment, along with a plea to protect the area's natural beauty, indicates a clear opposition to the current turbine project plan.

26/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Government,"At the moment there is no outline plan with a number on the blue line, but these days we are providing a plan for the blue line, according to a preliminary estimate to reach the maximum of TMA 35 which speaks of 300, not least if at some stage the status of the settlement is determined it could also increase For 500, we already know today that even to fill the 300, the blue line will not be enough, we will have to grow, and therefore yes 13 but we also need to examine, 12, we need to take - we will need the position of the Ministry of Defense regarding 11 the next line because we already Now they are promoting a plan, the turbines will not go down. And we must take into account the possibility of the settlement growing. I will mention something about the scenic effect on the residents or the residences, as I said before The Ministry of Housing, I say I look at it from the point of view of tenants and residents. The statement that they don't know how to evaluate and everyone says that in my opinion the landscape will have an impact like this, I think that something more professional and clear is needed here. To see perspectives, to see visualizations, of how this thing will look at eye level of residents, of people who live and of people --- so that we have something more faithful to talk about. As for the tobacco industry, at first they did not know the effects of smoking and said it was nonsense, until they began to discover its enormous effects. In addition to this, settlements need to understand that there are other consequences of this, settlements are torn from the inside around the internal dynamics that turbines flood. The value of houses can drop, settlements are abandoned. What we hear is evidence of things happening in the world. I can already tell you that the program is still in the planning stage, we are already witnessing difficulties within the settlements that are coming up with us, and also a significant drop in interest in receiving the settlement. It downloads while only --- in the program. A few months ago, the chairman of the energy market in the European Union and a world expert in the field of wind turbines and renewable energies, his name Marbit, came to our settlement --- we showed him the current turbine plan and the distances from the settlement and he reacted with great surprise. He said that we are far behind, in Europe they erected these turbines a decade ago, since then the residents who live by them have suffered a lot and they learned the hard way that they should be moved a few kilometers away. He was very surprised that we do not learn from their experience but repeat their mistakes. We are not ready to be left behind as cannon fodder with irresponsible plans that will harm us and our children. The TMA for the construction of turbines throughout the country was written in 2014, that's three years ago, it has a reference to the effect on birds, but there is no significant reference to the effect of the turbines on humans, this is complete negligence of the state. In the plan in question, turbines are planned at a height of 180 meters, yet Even one turbine of this size has been built in the country. The turbines that already exist in the settlement of Gilboa are less than half the height of these turbines, they are less than a kilometer away and violate the way of life of the residents. The turbines in the Golan are out of order and they are Standing there as a show in the landscape, this is also something that needs to be taken into account, the turbines remain, there is no one to operate them, the developer has retired, they remain there, they are not dismantled, they remain there, it happens in the world, it is just there in the landscape. The TMA of the wind turbines was written without reference distances from human settlements, only at the beginning of this was added to the TMA the recommendation of the Ministry of Health for a distance of 500 meters from settlements. In light of this recommendation, first of all, how could turbines be erected less than 500 meters from our blue line, where were we in this process, what kind of public participation was there With us, when did we have the opportunity to really make our voices heard and discuss our claims seriously. The meaning of these distances is a complete blocking of our ability to develop as a settlement. I hope this is understandable.__ How can it be that the program continues and functions without carrying out these tests that the Ministry of Health directed. We clearly see from around the world that the global regulation is getting stricter regarding the distances of turbines from human habitation. The truth is that it may be possible to show it - you can nine and ten. Look, we are Israel at five hundred, we are at the bottom and we don't have turbines, it's a joke. There are more graphs, ok. I will just give a few examples from this, most of the countries, so we are at the lower limit. Most of the countries today already pass the thousand meters, --- to 3000 meters, Bavaria, Poland and Ireland stand at 2000 meters and so on. Now I will say in Denmark for example that it was before, most of the national energy is produced from wind, and the standard is relatively low only at 700 meters but there most of the turbines in general moved from the land to the sea, as part of a global movement to make turbines in the sea, because this may be the right place for it. In the Ministry of Health document, it is stated that the Ministry will be periodically updated with additional studies regarding the effects of long-term exposure to infrasound and the regulatory changes of other countries. In the TMA of the wind turbines there is a mechanism of updating every four years, it is time to update the recommendations of the Ministry of Health and the TMA in light of the findings of the world. We are strongly opposed to approving this plan before this move happens. Now this is a national issue, I am in contact in the very north about hundreds of turbines, people there are shocked, in recent months people there have been on their feet against these plans, they want to strip the entire north, there will be no scenic area, it will block the settlements. Last Thursday, the heads of the councils of the north and the heads of the authorities discussed this issue and proposed their own series that talks about .
Both with regard to Shani Birch and regarding Mount Amsha, Shani Birch from what I know, which is also a plan with our assistance to already reach 500 according to TMA's decision, it is really expanding towards the west, that's why - Birch Shani, that's why the current situation of the eastern houses It's no coincidence that --- there is also a stream there, a wadi, regarding Mount Amsha, we are right now in the process of establishing contracts for a program that will reach the ceiling of 300, which already - it will really begin to roll out, according to a preliminary check I did on the blue line, already at 300 to reach the ceiling of the 300, required for a blue line extension. I'll put it this way, assuming we'll have to, if his daughter the blue line, 11 turbines, if they are taken down, the blue line - there is no problem with it, but assuming that we have to establish a blue line as Ali said according to the conditions of the area, unlike Livna, and we cannot expand to the east, there is a nature reserve, expansion to the south is limited, so we are Yes, we should perhaps consider the second line of turbines of 5,6,7, distances very close to each other",1,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly focusing on the negative impacts on local communities and the environment. They mention the opposition from local residents and authorities in the north, who are upset about the potential loss of scenic areas and the encroachment on settlements. The speaker also highlights the need for updated health recommendations and regulatory changes based on new studies and international practices, suggesting that the current assessments may not be sufficient.

Up to 500 meters there is definitely a risk of health consequences, which is why we set this line of 500 meters.

It cannot be acceptable that one birder for an entire spring sits in a position without a single day off seven days a week and to think that the survey he will issue under his hands will be a reasonable survey, this is what happened in the spring in this program and in my view it is something that cannot be accepted as reasonable data, this is one issue. The second issue, the radar data according to my best professional judgment did not create a reliable picture of what is happening in the forest. This radar has a drastic drop in its detection ability beyond 1100 meters, the radar is placed more or less about a thousand meters from the plan, it is placed high , its beam in some places due to topographic lowering of --- did not coincide with the turbines at all and all the work of the -- all the radar data are in my opinion not reliable enough to rely on.

They claimed that if the distance is then there is an escape in the detection of the radar, even though we proved that up to three kilometers the radar sees well and it doesn't - we completed one more figure that they were missing, the second figure what happens below - because this is a mountainous area, there are parts What to do, the radar sends out a beam, there are parts under the radar beam that the radar did not see, it is usually the low area of ​​the turbines, not the area of ​​the blades, for this too we extrapolated and completed the data based on completing the missing height at each point area that the radar beam did not see, we also made a supplement regarding this, and therefore from the number displayed there, both the correction of the distance regarding the detection distance and what is under the radar beam, we completed these two data, presented them, and also transferred the base data of the radar to , not a dispute - no, but David, it is important that you understand, the dispute is not about the data itself, about the fact that we did not transfer a table of how the calculation was performed.

The speaker also mentions coordination with an ecologist and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, indicating efforts to adhere to environmental guidelines and address specific concerns raised during the project's approval process. The focus on having met all demands and provided all requested information suggests a supportive stance towards the project, aiming to demonstrate compliance and proactive engagement with regulatory and environmental requirements.

I just want to show something that is important to address because the developer presented the distance from the blue line as if these three turbines were to come down then everything would be solved, but we see that it is a distance of 442 that is under 500 meters, now this is the approved plans for our extensions, in addition thank you very much In any case, this --- if you look at the distances to the other turbines from this extension, then it is a distance of 574 meters, 608 meters, 694, it is not much more than 500 meters OK.

26/06/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Government,"Good morning, first of all we issued a detailed opinion in preparation for the discussion that took place in March in the committee, and I will not add all the issues. The opinion is mostly still valid and we do know what it says that, apart from some changes made to the program, our opinion is somewhat updated. I think that despite the great resources that the company invested and we also invested and all the statutory bodies that are supposed to check, especially on the subject of the survey have wings to this day even though there were discussions and summaries, with the Planning Bureau, we did not receive all the material that would allow us in terms of our role as a regulator to check the data and give an opinion on the matter of the - especially on the subject of the survey of winged people, to bring here today information that is, an opinion that is final, etc. You have to understand that checking such a job is not an easy job, and if the information we have is incomplete information, we, as those who are supposed to bring the information here, have difficulty doing it, and I think that this information should have been today already information that would be passed on to us and we would be in the situation today and we would can give a full opinion, I think that making a decision on this issue today would be a mistake, I think that the committee should have all the complete and correct information before making a decision. I want to get down to the specific sections, I will divide it into three, this is the winged survey, the issue of the environmental impact review and our recommendations for the program instructions. So about today's survey---it really went through stretch correction and extrapolation, everyone will find the right word. According to our requirement and the numbers have been updated, the correction is primarily due to the fact that there is one single bird and one single bird is not able to cover the entire area of ​​the turbine. So we are here on a case of statistical inference. The estimate currently stands at 300 migratory birds per day in the farm area. That's quite a number. We took the - following the extrapolation, the developer did not re-evaluate the damage survey using the damage model, we did according to his data and to our understanding each turbine is approximately expected to damage between 5.2 and 6.3 winged animals per year. This brings us to an order of magnitude of 80 birds per year per day in just days. This is in terms of the damage to the winged. This is the results of the model and this is the order of magnitude, this is of course not an original figure. We have to remember that any survey that we do not carry out, any actual survey, will always give an underestimation of what is actually happening, because there is nothing to be done, there is nothing to be done. So, as I said, radar work is complex work, and although three meetings were held under the auspices of the Planning Bureau, until this minute we have not received everything that was agreed upon in the meeting, and this does not allow us to present today in terms of - an unequivocal statement that the information has been checked and verified by us And I think it's a shame. We can what the developer presented in the work he did and I say once again, we couldn't check it because we didn't have the basic things to check them, it's talking about about 300,000 or so, 300,000 signals, also we don't give a final number of wingmen that are expected to be but Just the number of the same radar and that needs to be calibrated. This is data that was not presented as part of the work. The original estimate was 60,000 after the treatment 280,000, I think it's a shame that they didn't show us the data, we could have referred to it. That's it, regarding the summary I'll try to be brief. In total, the survey carried out and the statistical correction are acceptable to us, these are the numbers that we think are realistic, what I have presented is of course an underestimation. The injury per day model speaks of between 67 and 82 birds per year, in the area of ​​the farm, when it comes to 13 turbines. A significant part of the expected damage is precisely to the white Hasids. We think that with a correct operating regime as this specific society operates in the world, it is possible to reduce this damage especially on the issue of Hasidism, to reduce the damage significantly, with an operating regime and regarding the results of the explanatory radar. Regarding the environmental impact report. The first issue I want to address is the issue of the expansion of the village of Har Amsha, the review was done and presented to us. There was no change of land designation from a farm building to a residential one, in the area closer to the turbine farm, northwest. All tests 15 Plenary meeting Meeting of 6/26/2017 N.S. ""Protocol"" - because at the end of this, what remains of this transcript was compiled by an outside company and did not undergo inspection or proofreading by a professional at the Planning Bureau and the environmental assessments that were carried out, all the models and all the tests, were carried out according to the approved plan and according to the local residential change that was carried out in the southern part of the settlement. If the planning institution accepts the settlement's position that it wants to allow what we think is appropriate, to allow the development of Mount Amsha to a population size of 500 units, we need to update and check exactly what the effects are on the environmental tests that were done, because it is now a different plan, the plan as it is presented It was not examined in the review, on the face of it, it seems that if the turbines move away, then it is a benefit. But I say once again that this issue of treating the entire blue line as a sensitive area, was not examined as part of an environmental impact review, which is something that is very important, which we will need to make a decision on it and we think it is correct. Since the turbines have an environmental impact, we also request that the area of ​​impact of the plan be limited in it. Obviously, it will not be possible to carry out any sensitive uses in the future. This is something that the committee should take into account in decision making. Regarding the noise section, it also appears in its entirety in the original opinion, according to what was presented in the review there is not expected to be an abnormality in the noise at the receivers, also in the matter of low frequency noise intensity, according to what was presented in the documents there should not be an abnormality. The noise is heard and we think that this whole issue of standards and thresholds should be anchored in the program's instructions. We will soon talk about it and that the policy issued by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, should be the threshold value by which to determine what is allowed and what is not. In terms of landscape, we believe that, as I presented in the original opinion, the impact is going to be very, very significant, we divided it from Mebek Rim that can be an attraction for them, but there is no doubt that the residents who are well represented here in this room, the landscape that is going to be in their living environment is going to change in a very significant way. Even in a way I allow myself to say harshly. Regarding the management of operations, etc., I think that such a plan, especially the first plan, we recommend establishing some kind of surveillance, monitoring and control team, many of the things here go to the permit stage and the operation stage. We think there should be some kind of team here, let's appoint a team of course that will be a balanced team, from the representatives of both the relevant offices and the developer and the residents, who will follow up on things, see that things are really according to what was agreed, that the residences are being carried out, know what to do as a result of the monitoring, also to prevent conflicts. There is no doubt that such a thing I think can be especially helpful for operation. Apart from these issues, we of course think that it is necessary to recommend incorporating the review editor's recommendations into the program's instructions, apart from the sections that are obviously in conflict with the opinion. Now in section 4 I have included here a number of changes that are required in the program's instructions, some of them are instructions that the developer proposed, some of them are instructions that the developer proposed with minor changes. Some of them are instructions that the ministry has proposed. I don't know how you want to do it, maybe project it or I'll just say. The sections are first of all sections regarding the jittering of compliance with the standards. Monitoring of vibration, compliance with noise standards, issue of the focus of the noise during operation. Subject of the infra sound, compliance with the standards._ If I summarize then I say that for us on the subject of the bird survey the information is incomplete, we think it is wrong to make a decision on these subjects. As far as the other issues are concerned, I think we have received quite a response, and if of course these things are implemented, I think that in the matter of the survey things are expected to meet the standards_ No, our recommendation is not to deposit, yes I said, I am saying that in the matter of the winged survey the matters are not yet complete, we have not received all the information As agreed upon and we think that until all the information is received and presented to the committee in full, it is incorrect. Regarding the missing radar data, the summary file of all the radar data in the summary table, including the way the statistical calculation was performed, was not forwarded to us in a way that makes it possible to understand what was done.",0,0,0,1,1,Weakly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses concerns about the adequacy of current assessments, particularly regarding avian impacts, and emphasizes the need for more comprehensive monitoring and information before proceeding with the project. They suggest the formation of a balanced team including representatives from relevant offices, the developer, and residents to ensure compliance and address any issues during the operation stage. The speaker also mentions the need to incorporate certain recommendations into the program's instructions and highlights the lack of complete information on bird surveys, suggesting that it is premature to make a decision based on the current data. This indicates a cautious approach to the project's approval, focusing on ensuring all standards are met and all necessary information is obtained.

All in all, instead of smoke, we produce other things and let's be careful that we don't hurt people either, it's not so much - I'm not sure how deeply this will be examined, more the ecological issues, the animals, the winged animals and so on, were examined here, I'm not arguing. Regarding the issue of distances, the area of ​​Yatir is quite a special area in our province, I don't need to tell you. Options there for the expansion of settlements are not so great, there is a forest there, there are values ​​there, there are nature reserves there, there are all kinds of things. That's why the reference to a blue line in this specific case of Har Amsha at least as well as of Livna, it is desirable that it be at the forefront of our concern because currently the settlement is merely planned as a kibbutz, they have experience building residences based on the old plan. But we've already seen enough versions of a plan, that essentially the entire expansion is on this side of the northwest or a significant part. And I wouldn't underestimate it. We will soon take off this hat and wear the hat of a housing unit, it is a commitment of this committee and we should not start saying what is more important. I think it's important, right, and it's also important. So let's not close the door on the possibility of expanding Mount Amsha. As soon as we took down all three of these stations by chance - I didn't have to fight here because the position of the Ministry of Defense made it easier for us. So we are already within reasonable range.

But the way they defined it to me once, they said the location of this place, is one of the amazing places, we are in heaven, we live in hell inside ourselves, it doesn't matter. This settlement is currently on its blue line plan and will have room for 300, 300 is planned and it cannot grow now. I can't say about an existing plan, maybe one day they will want to change it, blue line, maybe they will increase beyond 300, currently TMA 35 is limited to 300. And what they have today is suitable for 300. Now I was abroad, I traveled a lot to see turbines. It interested me. I was in the United States, I drove 150 kilometers and I kept seeing turbines. I was now in Crete, I went to see turbines, -- there is a village above the villages, there is a village below, on the mountain, turbines. I didn't have a laser meter, I didn't measure, nor did I think about distances. I went to see it as a tourist site, I didn't mind seeing tall turbines in the forest, I didn't mind the view, the opposite I don't know, it doesn't - I don't mind. but . They started at 19, they are now down to 10, it doesn't matter, today they are at 10 and I think alternative energy in the Golan Heights, I think they have approved it now, yes it has been approved for deposit, it has been approved for deposit with turbines like this I think it is 180. With 180 meter turbines, I'm not saying it's damaging the landscape and I think the opposite, I think quite the opposite, that it can add tourism, which is something interesting.

If it complies with these rules and goes down, I am always with the Ministry of Defense, and I asked him if it is also dangerous --- he told me yes, then at all --- against these three turbines.

So I have to say that in Yeshiva that we have covered this issue, the type of radar, its location, the beam and everything that is included by the radar and the bird, with the exception of the construction that creates the statistical analysis which is one and not two, all these other elements are elements that are accepted in accordance with the guidelines in accordance with the guidelines established for the environmental impact review for the survey Wing owners, we don't have an argument today, we are not at the stage of arguing whether it was true or not, it is already too late, we are already behind.

We are very far from achieving the government's goals, I know it sounds like a never-ending mantra, but we are really far and there are very few projects in the wind sector and that is also 730. This project can provide something like 55 megawatts, that's a lot, it may sound like a small percentage but The importance of this and the development and connection of electricity to the system is enormous. It is clear that there is some kind of price here, everything has a price, the renewable energies came from another price that we pay, especially here in the district, by the way, in all the conventional stations and in the complex --- and no one hides this price. At the same time, apart from the issue of air quality, the turbines bring with them profit, they are a very significant lever, we see this today in Ma'ale Gilboa, also in the development of tourism for the settlement, as well as the second and third circles that the turbines create and there is a pilgrimage center there, you are welcome to go up on Saturdays and see what it's like Looks - really is a focal point. --- I am in favor of this type of tourism development, but it is important, in most of the communities here agriculture today encounters quite a few difficulties and it is important. For the energy economy, these projects have enormous weight. I think there are a lot of issues mixed up here, some of which are operational, and they are not issues of planning, they should be discussed at the next stage, like the issue of firefighting, a plan is something very rigid, you do it once, it's like a law that you write and then change This is an impossible mechanism. Operational aspects need to be examined, need to be tested, need to get a full solution to all the issues that arise, but I'm not sure this is the stage. Yes, the plan should ensure the mechanisms that in the next step things do not fall through the cracks, but certainly should not determine whether it is a meter or two meters or four trees or three trees. Because a program is like a law, a law is not changed every Monday and Thursday, I think this is a very significant issue. I think that the development of the settlements must not be harmed, even if there is some kind of price to be paid, but in the plans that are still being formulated or in the initial draft, they can take the turbines into account, after all, the development of a settlement is not just houses, there are other land uses that need It is true that the turbines can be a constraint --- or otherwise, but less sensitive uses can be brought closer to them. There is nothing to be done, we are a dense country, we are a small country, this is part of our needs and just as there is unification of infrastructures on this issue, this is also a form of unification of infrastructures. It is true that it is not comfortable for everyone, I wish we had the spaces, we wouldn't have to crowd and that everyone could keep the distances they wanted and we would argue less. I think that the committee --- I think that the development of land uses should be reduced as much as possible and it doesn't matter if it is wind turbines in the settlement, of course without harming environmental aspects and such, but if it meets the conditions and everything, there is no reason to save kilometers now, just because of all kinds Concerns that we know have no ground in light of what is happening in the world. It is true that many studies and many things were said here, we can pass on some document that was distributed at the time precisely by the environmental organizations, which was explicitly written that there is no scientific literature for this, it is all gray literature, so these things should also be said, I am not a doctor, this is not my field, I'm not going to replace any other body here, but a lot of things were said here that are not true, let's say. Just one more word, I think that the removal of the three turbines may not be good for the energy economy, but it does produce some kind of balanced solution, RTG --- specifically the three turbines that are both from the point of view of the bats and from the point of view of the Ministry of Defense, usually we -- I do think that this is some kind of solution. We are really asking for a solution, a lot of work has been done, this is the third time that I have come here, I think that the time has come to make a decision and it is okay to oppose, anyone who does: why this The Rotenberg power plant is different now, it has a sphere of influence, you breathe its air, it's its sphere of influence, it's not its construction limitations, why here you want to invent a new thing that doesn't exist anywhere --- it's much more than the sphere of its construction limitations.

Yes, there is a reference, I mean a bird that stands in one place is what is called in the professional language, yes it can be corrected, you have to remember that if you see a count sparrow a thousand times then it is like me telling you that your child will cross the road but it is only for two seconds. But if he does these two seconds a thousand times, it is clear to you that the risk of being run over increases significantly and therefore the risk of injury can be considered, the absolute amount of individuals in the field can be considered, it can be fixed, it is not a problem. The method we proposed is the accepted method and in our opinion the right one.

05/08/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Environmental organizations,"Hello, I'm Yaron Charka, the chief birder of KKL-Junk. In the previous discussion that was here in March, today's discussion was decided, we met for a limited meeting on March 19, and there it was decided that the raw radar data would be transferred to me for review and once it was transferred to me, I would be given a month to review them. The data was transferred to me on the eve of Pesach on 4/9, and it hasn't been a month yet, but nevertheless I have spent the last few nights without it, it was also Passover in the middle and holidays and stories are not important. We really asked to postpone, but that's why I'm presenting preliminary things here today and I want to focus on three main things. One is the issue of radar signal attenuation over distance, the second is the ability to reliably estimate the amount of birds sampled in a polygon based on the radar data and the third is the correlation between radar and birders. So let's start with the issue of signal attenuation as a function of range. In their report The entrepreneurs claimed --- the claim of a decrease in the radar's reception capacity has no basis, they were based on the fact this claim was based on this graph copied from their report, you can see in this graph that a range of up to 5000 meters is covered in almost all directions very well. But if we look at the distribution of the significant signals, yes what we call tracks, as a function of the distance, then the picture is completely different. I sampled from the data I received, I sampled the signals again in all quarters of the scope in a similar way to what you see here, but this is the graph of the distribution, you see something completely different here, if you see a peak in the range of - you see here a peak of radar signals at a distance of 700 meters About and another smaller peak at a distance of about 1100 meters, and after this peak a sharp drop and everything that happens from 1100 meters further, the radar does not detect significant signals of birds. The furthest point in the polygon that the developers defined is about 4200 meters from the radar and you understand the meaning that everything is something like according to this graph, a great many birds that passed through the polygon were not detected by the radar at all, if we give a slightly more accurate scheme of this , so actually something like 95% yes up to 2000 meters if we are talking about a range of 4200 , then only half a percent only half of the area of ​​the polygon at all is covered by the radar according to this graph of the distribution. I have a short time, I move on to the next topic. In terms of the treks that the entrepreneurs' report identifies, treks for that matter is poultry that the entrepreneurs' radar on detects compared to what I saw in the same data itself. So, first of all, I want us to have a table from the report, that is, there is one line here that quotes numbers from the report, the same page, of the amount of treks in general, before any processing done before filters, etc., you see in the top line the numbers that the entrepreneurs reported and you see in the line The second on the same the numbers I found in their data, you see that in total we are more or less the same. The differences are only a few percentages except in February page. Apparently the story of February, I don't know, but I assume that this huge difference in February is due to the fact that they didn't take all of February, after all the radar also passed in March, April, May and June. When they They wrote the report or when the data they entered in the report was probably up to part of February, everything, all I am showing here is that there is no disagreement between us, shame on the debate, I think February here is unusual and all in all what I found is more or less what they found, It's a shame you're jumping in. So now I'm going into a little more depth about the characteristics of the treks sampled and here too if you look at the direction, so the directions are more or less the same, in the framed article I'll say that this direction is not significant at all, because it's just average Between zero and 360 the speeds I saw are similar. What is different is the number of tracks and the range from the radar. Only in terms of where I sample, compared to - I don't know, the developers in their report were not transparent enough about what migration seasons are for them, where exactly are the boundaries of the polygon, this is something that changes in their documents several times, but what I defined is September to November as autumn, December February as winter and March to May as spring. I didn't include June at all, even though there is some data, because it's not really a migration season, it might be the end of spring, and I also took down the 24.10 that fell due to rain. I took a polygon from zero to minus 4000 on the x axis and minus you can see that it is similar but what is different, Y 500 to minus 1500 meters south of the radar on the h axis First of all the range is different from the radar, this difference is easily explained because the data I showed you of the entrepreneurs or The data that the developers have here includes the masking of all the first 1500 meters from the radar, therefore the entire eastern part of the polygon is not included in these data at all, therefore their average range is much further, because all the closest ones are not included in the average at all. I have to finish, I have time Short. What is more disturbing, I mean the whole issue of range from the radar is not disturbing here, what is more disturbing is the differences in the number of treks, in the number of birds that I see in my analysis, compared to the number of birds that the entrepreneurs see in their report, you see a total of two seasons here The migration they are talking about here is 43,344, and if you add up my numbers it is 216, I go right into the amendment document that was submitted on 2/15 and there they removed the masking from the eastern part, and after an assessment they make, after removing the masking they make an assessment of between sixty and sixty-five thousand poultry in the farm area , in the two migration seasons it is still sixty sixty-five which is about three and a half times less than what I reached. I tried even more to understand what caused this discrepancy and I changed the boundaries of the polygon, and when I moved the boundaries of my polygon a little, I actually moved it 750 meters to the west, so I reached ninety-almost ninety-five thousand signals, which is still much higher than their estimate. But that's about one and a half times higher than their estimate but it's getting closer. And this can perhaps explain the unclear boundaries of a polygon, but it also illustrates to you the sensitivity of where exactly you define the polygon and in their report there are all kinds of polygons and this story needs to sit down one day, all of us together, define it and close this story. The entrepreneurs defined the polygon. I go in to score The third thing I want to talk about is the correlation between the birders and the radar. Again, I'm showing you a graph from the survey, from the report, and this graph shows a very, very high correlation between the birders' reports and the radar data in the area of ​​the - in the farm's polygon. And it is based here on 14 days, I have no idea why the entrepreneurs chose to show these 14 days, but from what I found it is very, very different, the 14 days are also included here, I analyzed 52 days here, which is all the days of the overlap between For the birders, let me explain this graph a bit, the blue lines are the samples of the radar, the orange lines are samples of one of the birds and the gray lines of another bird, in fact there are two birders that worked while the radar was also working, and you see that many times the birds are Much higher than the radar, there are places like on October 7, which was a record day for the migration of woodpeckers that day in the whole country, the radar sees a lot, how many are there? Over 12,000 birds, in this case Carmel sees almost nothing. There are other days like this where the radar sees much more than Carmel, but on most days both Carmel and Eran see more than the radar. In any case, this graph is very, very different from the graph you see on the left and I don't really understand what the graph on the left is based on First of all, the radar here needs to understand this, it was operated with a horizontal beam and not a vertical beam, most of the treatment of birds in Israel is also in other turbine farms and when we see today the results of radar reports from other turbines in the north, they are infinitely better than the results - good in the sense of radar is able to identify which bird it is, whether it is a hummingbird, a bird - choosing this method of a horizontal beam is a problematic choice. The promoters claimed that there is no decrease in the detection ability of the radar with distance, so they said we can look at the polygon itself and say what was in it, even though the remote parts of the polygon are over 4000 meters from the radar, I have shown this claim here in the distribution graph which is incorrect. We have shown that there is a decay. The number of birds sampled in the farm area is very sensitive to the definition of the boundaries of the polygon, and in the reports of the entrepreneurs there are several boundaries of polygons, we also showed that there is no sample between the radar and the bird reports - and in the end we are also not given enough time to give an established risk assessment. What I want Asking is two things, 1. I think it is necessary to continue to sit down with the entrepreneurs to understand how we analyze in an agreed upon manner. No one here is asking to change the location of the radar or its model. I want based on the existing data to sit down and try to reach an agreement on how we model and I think the way they chose is unacceptable but we can sit down and reach an agreement on the basis of the existing data. A second thing that is important and I haven't brought it up here yet, is the topic of birdwatching. I want to see the raw data of the bird's expectations, the heights. I don't think it should delay, I just want to summarize in one important sentence, KKL-Junk as one of the green bodies in the State of Israel sees a very, very great importance in renewable energies. We are not categorically opposed to any renewable energy, not even to turbines. But we believe that it is necessary to check the All these things and to see if the grief is worth the damage to the king and if there is too much damage to the environment, we do not think that where there is damage, we do not yet say that there is here, we want to reach a situation where first of all we have agreed upon numbers",0,0,0,1,0,Weakly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses concerns about the current methodologies used in assessing the impact of wind turbines on bird populations, specifically criticizing the choice of radar technology and its implementation. They highlight discrepancies in data and boundary definitions that affect the accuracy of bird impact assessments. Despite these criticisms, the speaker also emphasizes a willingness to collaborate with developers to refine assessment methods and acknowledges the importance of renewable energy, indicating a desire to find a balanced solution rather than outright opposition. The speaker requests further discussions and access to raw data to better understand and potentially mitigate environmental impacts, but does not call for halting the project.

05/08/2017,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Developers,"5000 bird tracking radars worldwide, all but one, operated around 4000 are horizontal radars. The whole idea is the idea of ​​turning the radar beam relatively short and monitoring the birds that pass there, there is only one experimental radar, a Swiss one, that the State of Israel, because of some background related to the research that was carried out extensively twenty years ago, uses it and this radar It's a vertical looking radar and it's full of problems. Among other things, this radar monitors around the 200-meter diameter for a 200-meter round and then 90 from that to four, five, six ---. Everything that was said about the horizontal radar and the vertical radar, is not true, all the radars In the world they are horizontal radars, with the exception of this Swiss radar, two or three units of which are in Israel and nothing else and nowhere else in the world and no one has seen the data and no one has seen the renderings and no one has seen their assessments. Radars, all these radars are basically marine radars and they all go through some kind of conversion that allows using software and all kinds of other things to check and monitor birds because usually a radar doesn't monitor but sees something and forgets what it saw. And I won't go into the technical details here and it's not that relevant to the issue. I don't see the sensitivity of all the radars at all, I can't see it, the sensitivity of all the radars is very high in the first part of the beam at a distance of a few meters from the beam, so the radar sees dust and insects and raindrops and anything that flies In the air. That is why it is customary not to monitor the first meters around the radar and to start referring to what the radar sees from a distance of one thousand five hundred meters. Now what Sharon saw was a lot of insects A million signals of insects and dust around the radar that he monitored and the copier you saw at the beginning, it's not that huge peak at the beginning, it's just dust and pollution. He did not contact us at the time, he did not consult us, he was supposed to analyze the material in its entirety, he was supposed to check whether the radar actually sees what it sees and that we did not invent the data. The relevant slide from this point of view and from his point of view is that he saw the The number of signals we saw. That's it, that's basically the indication that our radar saw everything. Now regarding the number of signals decreasing with the distance, we explained it and passed it on in the scriptures and sat on it in yeshiva and sat on it yeshiva in Betir and with the same people also other yeshiva. The radar is pointing upwards, in Betir the position of the Betir radar was not optimal but there was no other option, he stood where he could stand. As a result of this the radar looks gradually as it moves further, it sees a narrow beam at an increasing height. Our claim is not that there are no birds, and our claim is not that we come in full coordination with the birders, our claim is that at the height where the turbines come out there are a relatively small number of Birds. As you move away from the radar, the height also increases and the number of birds at this height is relatively low, there are birds below the height of the radar's wings, we did not explain this in the report either. Below the radar height were birds. They're down, they're where most birds are most of the time, they're not in danger. We addressed this in the risk model. We talked about birds that are under the radar, birds that are inside the radar beam and birds that are on the radar beam. We explained the differences between the perception between what we saw, what the birders saw and what the radar saw. The analysis Shiron brought was an analysis that took these things into account. It was not a raw analysis of raw data but a processed analysis of the data. And what I find myself standing here is after about six months of analysis conducted both here and in conference calls with Canada that produces the round-trip radar and comparisons between different sites and birds. I suddenly find myself having to protect processed data against raw data. This is very It's nice that he released raw data, I wasn't sure he could release raw data, it's very nice but these are not the final data. We were asked to try to correct the decrease in the bird's ability to see birds. Assaf proposed a method, which is acceptable, but it is not acceptable for a bird standing in one place And I won't go into details, I will go into details, it is not acceptable for a birder who works in one place and she cannot fill the area with bird data that a birder sees from a single point where he stands. If a birder sees a thousand sparrows during the month that he stands in one place, no You can take these thousand sparrows and extrapolate them to an area of ​​four square kilometers, because these thousand sparrows are the same sparrows that come every day to see why the bird is still there. That's why we can't do it, the method is correct. As Assaf presented it, but not for what we did. We took and did a processing, I took and did a more detailed statistical processing that checked whether the decrease in the bird's ability to see is only related to the bird's ability to see or the route of the area, or the height at which it sees the birds or the direction it sees the birds, whether He sees differently when he looks into the sun or sees differently when he looks towards the shadow. We did a statistical analysis - I did a statistical analysis that gave a much more complex and much more correct answer and I used this method to fill in the gaps that the birds the birders saw.

For that matter, the logic talks about some kind of turbine harming a bird, so it actually harms a protected nature value and a permit is required for that. That's the logic. Specifically about the story of the birdwatcher survey, and there was an in-depth discussion about the harm to birdwatchers and this was reflected in the committee's decisions, and I think that now to go back and discuss once again the level of harm to birdwatchers at the statutory level, I think this discussion has been exhausted, to the point and I think it would not be correct.",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project.

So with regard to TMA 35 and TMA 22 and to the SHP, the committee approved the plan, which is fine. But the committee brought up two issues, one issue required us to add I from reading - required us to add the RTG in the follow-up committee, to the accompanying team, the RTG C. She demanded to add, no, I will read, the committee also decides to add the RTG representative to the accompanying team. But wait, let me finish, but she gave us the district committee the opportunity to examine the composition of the team and balance it as we think is right. So I will read the rest of this section. In light of his expertise - RTG to the accompanying team in light of his expertise, in addition, the committee recommends to the district committee to examine the need to correct the composition of the team for the sake of balance. So we have to add RTG, we can examine the composition of the team, this is one issue. The second issue and is the first in the order of their decisions, is the issue of reference to the issue of the winged survey and specifically to the issue of --- values. What is happening is that in the North District a plan in Kfar Yehezkel was approved, not approved, a plan in Kfar Yehezkel was promoted in which the manner in which the threshold values ​​were determined was different than the manner in which it was determined in our case, the NAA did not decide for us that it should be this way or another way but she directed us to re-examine the section This while referring to what was written in the North. I just want to say in the framed article, this was also not the position of the Planning Administration in the past, because in the North there is a reference to exact numbers of how many winged animals of each type can be harmed, we think it is wrong to write such a thing in the plan's instructions , because it's not planning language, first of all, secondly, it's not good for either party because if these threshold values ​​change for one reason or another for severity or relief, they're here in the program and they can't change. We just think it's not true at all, so we We looked at another option and we have a proposal, either we will read it or you want - secondly, we were accompanied by the head office of the planning administration all the way, which is not the method he supported, we asked for generic clauses so that it would be easier for us to accept them and that it would be uniform For the whole country, they didn't have generic clauses and they still don't have generic clauses. We used a different method, they didn't make claims against the system, they just thought it was more correct to produce some kind of uniform outline. Since Ezekiel was ahead of us then in the context of what you said, I want to say this, our proposal focuses on this thing, we want to define what threshold values ​​are, which I don't currently have in the program and I will say how we define it in the context of what you said with the law of protection. After that we have two sections in the conditions for granting a building permit that exist today, we are just upgrading them according to the definition, we are going to the definition because the definitions section in the program's instructions will add a definition to threshold values. The number of items - the definition is - the maximum number of items of a winged animal that will damage within the framework of the operation of the wind turbines without causing significant damage to the population of winged species, this links to the law that prohibits significant damage. The threshold values ​​will be determined from time to time by the team accompanying the program in accordance with the relevant professional information at that time. That's one, now as to what will be included in the program. I will begin, regarding instructions regarding damage to the wing owners, the committee does not see a place to establish a section that determines absolute numbers, in the committee's opinion, this type of determination is not relevant to the program and even limits the possibility of making optional future updates in this matter. The Planning Bureau proposes that section 6.2.2 be worded as follows - Wing owners - A. A condition for granting a construction permit will be the preparation of a detailed long-term monitoring plan, at least four years, with the approval of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Nature and Parks Authority, the Nature and Parks Authority will supervise the performance of monitoring and have the authority to recommend on measures to minimize/prevent injury to winged animals, before the surveillance team, as specified in section 6.11 of the instructions of this program. The monitoring will be carried out by a party agreed upon by the parties. B. The preparation of the preparedness plan in case the threshold values ​​are exceeded, for a species-specific damage that will include, for example, increased monitoring measures, damage minimization --- activation including temporary shutdown or --- - of turbines that cause significant damage to winged animals. We have both monitoring and a contingency plan. This is our proposal regarding threshold values, and I remind you that there is a definition of what is A and B, a condition for granting a construction permit will be the preparation of a detailed long-term monitoring plan, at least four years, with the approval of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Nature and Parks Authority, the Nature and Parks Authority will supervise Monitoring will be carried out and will have the authority to recommend measures to minimize or prevent harm to winged animals, to the monitoring team, as specified in section 6.11 of the provisions of this program. The monitoring will be carried out by a party agreed upon by the parties. B. Preparation of a preparedness plan in the event of exceeding the threshold values, for species-specific harm that will include, for example, increased monitoring measures, minimization of harm in the operating regime, including temporary or permanent shutdown of turbines that cause significant harm to winged animals. , we copy it like this - below are the powers of the monitoring team, preparing a professional opinion regarding monitoring plans, following up after monitoring the environmental effects of the turbine farms, noise, vibration, winged animals, examining the monitoring findings, determining threshold values ​​and giving an opinion regarding the implementation of the monitoring plan , changing and adjusting it from time to time, the monitoring team will be able to summon any person to its deliberations and demand from the presenter of the program and the operator of the turbine farm any qualified information. Wait a second, I want to say something, wait guys, a survey will be done here by the developer for a year, this document these instructions are entrusted in agreement with him. That is, he is convinced that there will be no injury for a long time, permanent injury, so you are now defending him, I don't understand. Something critical has been left out, the role of the monitoring team, I'll say it again, it's simply not written here despite the monitoring team's instructions, preparing a professional opinion regarding monitoring plans and plans for monitoring monitoring, the environmental effects of the turbine farm, noise, vibration, winged animals, examination The monitoring operations, determining the values ​​of s",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement reflects a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project.

This interpretation of RTAG A. If it is a law, it was prepared regardless of what will be written in the plan. We believe that it is wrong to adopt it here and I will also explain why. The only place RTAG receives permission for this harm is in the issue of hunting, which is intended To do deliberate harm to such and such species, in the matter of the turbines. The goal is not to harm the species, the goal is to generate green electricity, if there is damage of one kind or another on the road at one level or another, it is not the goal of intentional damage, in contrast to Tis, where a permit is actually given by the Nature and Parks Authority. We do not agree with this interpretation, we believe that the issue of threshold values ​​is not its role to be within a plan, as Rachel said, the plan for us is like regulations, like a law. We don't change the law every two days, what should be written there are binding instructions and clear instructions and not things that flexibility is required in the treatment phase of the life of the project which is going to be on the order of thirty years. We do agree that there should be a team, by the way a uniform team for the whole country, which seeing in the vision I am very connected to the issue of uniformity, I don't think that you should measure in centimeters and in the north you should measure with Google, I think that you should measure with the exact same ruler. We think that the issue of threshold values ​​is not a correct measuring tool, it will be impossible to deal with it, it will be impossible to prove what that wingman died of, if he died of cancer, or a collision or I don't know what he died of or old age. We are in favor of allowing a restriction regime, there are several solutions, we have learned a lot in the last few years, how can we deal with and reduce the damage, there was also a lot of damage, especially in the last year, because of how many institutions you are the first, but following you there were both Butel and in the northern district that decided to deposit plans, we began to deepen On the subject of an operating regime, there is a very broad toolbox that can be used, it should be on the table of the accompanying team that will open it, in order to bring about a reduction of the harm and that this will come through cooperation, through threshold values, in my opinion we will continue with wind turbines -- and not for cooperation, without cooperation of all parties it will not work, we are simply strongly opposed to the issue of threshold values.   I think that regarding the composition, the settlements should be made observers, there is no problem with the discussion - this is one time because the composition is unbalanced and there should be a representative of the local authority as far as the Galilee area is concerned, so yes the representative of the Planning Bureau should include all the needs in the area, many times there is a conflict in the fields of energy And water or within the fields of energy and we are perfected there is no choice, it is once about the team.

23/09/2019,699-0272872,מחוז דרום,Government,"OK, the plenary is a bit empty, so be it. What we are saying is that we actually submitted 11 d with specific clauses, Alon asked so I will answer him. We submitted section 11 d on specific sections, they can be divided into three main issues, one of which is the issue of the possibility of injury to those with wings, what to do with injuries to those with wings. Hitting winged animals I'm making this as general as possible, okay? I don't go into detail, it's one issue. The second issue is the issue of visibility observations of the turbine farms, and the third issue is all kinds of ambiguities that were in the decision. internal contradictions. I will list yes and also a fourth issue which is currently being said, RTG's status as a regulator is admittedly not something that is operative and implies things that can be changed in the plan, but it does have implications that will eventually be expressed in decisions in the plan that actually reduce RTG's status as a body regulatory for environmental affairs. I will list the things now, so first and foremost it should be said that in the last two years since the decision to deposit the program, a national policy has been formulated regarding the design of wind turbines and everything that concerns winged animals. We can see this policy in documents that have a binding statutory status, such as the ruling of the High Court of Justice on the issue of a wind turbine plan, Subtal 78, in the decisions of the National Authority on other plans for wind turbines. And in the documents of those plans themselves. Also plans under the authority of a committee district in the North District and also in plans with national authority. We think that there is some kind of alignment that says two main things, it says first of all that in the plan for wind turbines a numerical value should be determined regarding the number of blades that each turbine is allowed to cut in one year, there was a time when this was called a permit Today they changed it, it's called guiding values

The environment then I will continue then there is a national policy that says that a value should appear in the plan and the meaning of what happens if this value is exceeded should also be included in the plan. The High Court of Justice, for example, was very clear. I would like to quote what the High Court of Justice ruled on the subject of sub-paragraph 78. In our eyes, we see that there is meaning - in practice, the threshold value of harming one eagle, one uterus requires a stop, an investigation, investigation and application of the conclusions as soon as a conclusion is formed that there is an acute problem. In the operating regime, the necessary measures will be taken to improve and avoid additional vulnerabilities. The National Security Agency has determined with regard to two programs that it believes that it is appropriate for the program to determine the threshold values ​​for harm to those with wings. And there is room to state in the program's instructions that within the scope of the powers of the surveillance team there will also be instructions for taking measures, that is to say, there is a policy here. What I'm saying is that there is a national policy that says there should be - -. The next issue I'll be brief, fine, and I'll still stay with the winged ones, and this is about the bats, it was decided in section 1 of the decision that RTG's objection should be partially accepted regarding the lack of a plan regarding harm to bats, it was decided to partially accept the objection, which means that it needs to be answered. The answer given To this, the word ""bats"" was added after the word ""winged"" in a certain section, and this also shows a lack of understanding because bats are winged, but actually that section does not provide an answer to the problem, and in another decision later it was decided to delete part of that section. So the issue of harming bats was decided to be addressed In the end, it remains unanswered, because... the issue of bats is found both in the provisions of TAMA 41 today and - decisions that actually delete sections that you decided to change. Decisions that contradict each other. I will move on to the last topic which is the topic of real impact. The decision was actually I will do it in the broadest possible way as they say was actually not to discuss the scenic issue, the researcher's recommendation, which was basically received as language, I would like to read to all the members here who are not familiar with it the scenic issue was examined in detail as part of an environmental impact review, conducted A dynamic simulation model and the scenic consequences were presented, the turbines have an effect on the landscape, but the claim that the area will become an industrial area has no basis. That was the decision, actually the decision was that wind turbines no matter where and what, they will have the same scenic effect, no one has a right to the landscape - guys, it's short, I waited for you for three hours, please be with me. The apparent basic right to the landscape of the residents of the place is essentially no different from the right of other residents of the country whose rapid pace of development is also changing the landscape for them. So far I think we can agree on that. OK, no one has any right. Roads, railroad plots in populated areas unknowingly transform agricultural areas and invite further development alongside them. A response to the growing needs in housing units and it is actually reviewed here guys, the landscape is changing, no one has a proprietary right to the landscape, this change is proportional, this is a project in a small area, but the height His is a lot. Located in one particular corner in the northeast of the forest and does not harm the entire landscape of the forest. Regarding this statement, he does not harm the entire landscape of the forest, I completely disagree. 10 turbines 11 turbines at a height of 180 meters that are spinning can be seen from a great distance, there is no second dispute there is no dispute that the current landscape will change, the question of whether it is scenic damage is largely a matter of personal taste and then she says that such a scenic show will exist in every turbine farm I mean if we We will see the same turbines against the background of lines 400 and 55 will it look the same as it looks against the background of a forest? will exist in every turbine farm and accepting the claim that approval of a plan for turbines should be avoided because of the demonstration means preventing the possibility of their establishment in Israel. No one is talking about, at least we are not talking about rejection or approval, but we need to say here, guys, maybe lower some of the turbines, maybe move them, pay attention to four other programs about which decisions were made here very recently, District 12 in Ashdod, two programs for facilities Four-and-a-half-meter-high photovoltaics that were decided to be inappropriate because of their scenic appearance at a distance of 170 meters from residences.

The State of Israel also sent the Planning Administration in 2009, telling it to plan a national outline plan, and the Planning Administration did plan. When we got to the bridge for the approval of the TMA, something happened that is not right in terms of the fact that the TMA includes two routes: a route for building permits, which is a cheap route. Application for a construction permit - it has a price that is known in advance, and is a path that makes it economical for small and medium-sized turbines; And the TMA established a course of outline plans, which must be approached to the district committee, to approve an outline plan for changing the land's designation to a designation that allows the use of electricity production as an additional use. There are almost no industrial areas, where no one wants to build wind turbines, and there are areas that are farm buildings within the framework of agricultural associations, where it is perhaps most suitable to build turbines. What did the planning administration do - it recognized that there is extensive entrepreneurship here, especially in the north of the country, there is There was activity, developers submitted applications for building permits, the planning administration came - and I want to say this gently - with the assistance of the Ministry of Justice, they came and blocked the possibility that the developer could build a turbine without seven sections of hell.

When the power for each turbine is about 3 megawatts. The wind at the site should allow us to produce about 50 million kWh per year. This will actually allow the consumption of electricity for 7500 households. The facility will not be connected to high voltage, it will be connected to the distribution network with high voltage lines. And the height of its edge is up to 180 meters. When you You can see the typical dimensions of the turbines, 120 meters in height and 60 meters in length. In 2013, we received a feasibility survey from the international consulting company Gerard Hassan. In fact, a report that helped us understand the potential To produce energy on the site in 2014, as I mentioned before, the inter-ministerial team also started measuring wind on the site For February of this year, the plan was recommended for deposit by the Lower Galilee Committee. You can see the main points of the recommendation here. Here you can see the blue line. This is actually the agricultural area of ​​Kibbutz Lavi. To the south of this project is the kibbutz itself and its agricultural lands. You can also see the entrance to the facility that actually connects, the access road connects to an existing road. This is the recommended layout from our point of view for the 7 turbines. And all of them are really in the area that was recommended - by the inter-field office team - which is more crowded. In fact, we have infrastructures that place limitations on us. First of all - there is a 161 kV overhead line, it exists today north of the kibbutz. And there is also an approved route for a power line above 400 kilovolts that is planned in accordance with TMA / 10 / c / 6. It is north of our project. Because of the directives of the electric company that we will maintain a safety strip between the lines and the turbines, so this actually puts us somewhere in the middle Between the two lines, you can see it here, because we have to keep a few hundred meters of principle design for each turbine.
No. I will show you the 3 connections shortly. You can see it in the construction appendix. You don't see the network itself here, really. so sorry There is a cast gravity foundation. It basically forms the base of the turbine, it's 20 by 20 meters in size. and a main surface for a main crane measuring 40 by 40 meters. As you asked, so actually the actual expenditure of the electricity is done by up to 3 high voltage distribution lines. When there will be no overhead power lines and there will be no connection to the Tahmash. There is no need to establish a Tahmash. In each such connection when we said there are up to 3, then in each high voltage connection there is a collection network which is a hidden line that collects the electricity produced by the turbines and connects them, and is the one that takes the electricity to the switching room. Each high voltage connection has one switching room of approximately 50 square meters in size and due to the limitation of feasibility studies to deal with voltage control, there is an option for an additional room or a container of approximately 30 square meters in size. And during the entire period of activity we will place a measuring mast at a height of about 80 meters. You can see here some visualization of the things I said. of the landscape area of ​​40 x 40 and a turbine base that is 20 x 20 meters in size. And the branding room will reach up to 80 square meters. So during the construction phase we are of course planning to make use of existing roads as much as possible to allow the continuation of agricultural activity. The turbine itself comes in parts from the factory, the assembly itself is done on site with the help of cranes on top of the cast base. Cranes with a lifting capacity of 500 tons and 250 tons. All the infrastructure work, foundation, construction and so on, all this is done in a period of six months to a year.

This means that they have the lowest environmental impact. The turbines in the olive groves. We believe that they will be able to help preserve the agricultural character, by strengthening the ability of the landowners to continue cultivating the plantations. Even here in open areas, we believe that the turbines enable the circulation of renewable energy in a relatively limited land area compared to the northern region. Quoting here from an opinion for a review. These are the turbines selected as having the lowest impact. Also from the summary of the discussion of the district committee which stated that the committee believes that there is nothing in the plan in its revised form to damage the envelope of a landscape complex. Yes, at another meeting, the committee was convinced that the damage of the proposed construction to the values ​​of nature, landscape, agriculture, heritage, and the continuity of open areas is proportionate and makes the plan possible. Reviews of modeling work will be done if you want, we will expand on any subject that there are questions about. Regarding the coordination of the connection to the road, we will make a detailed coordination with Israel Routes as a condition - for a construction permit. But at the moment it is actually proposed to enter the organization area from an interchange area that exists in the approved plan. Also exists in the area if this interchange is not developed, there is an agricultural road there that allows access. Regarding coordination, coordination was made with all the parties. I will not elaborate here. You know the topics. We see here the connection of the two programs. The previous plan and our plan. In red the connection",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement provided indicates a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project. The speaker highlights the thorough review and selection process of turbine locations to ensure minimal environmental impact, mentioning that out of 47 locations, only 5 were chosen due to their low impact on nature. They also emphasize compliance with the district master plan and coordination with relevant authorities, which aligns with support indicators such as discussing project logistics, mentioning coordination with authorities, and focusing on adherence to guidelines. Additionally, the speaker addresses potential concerns by offering to provide further details and expand on any questions, which shows a proactive approach to addressing and managing impacts.

First of all, the same letter that arrived during the last few weeks, - to the second entrepreneur to Enlight, actually refers to all the farms as a whole. That is, he also mentions the southern farm, a place that should be downplayed as much as possible in new compositions. The extension does not actually offer a new connection. There is an approved interchange here by virtue of an approved program. So now, as much as it is possible to connect to this arm then we can. There is a successful login here. In practice, there is an agricultural road that connects, this interchange does not physically exist in the field. There is an agricultural road here that connects to the existing road. So both solutions exist. As long as the solution is not established, it does not exist, then it will not be possible to connect to it, the connection will be a connection to the existing road. As long as this interchange is developed as a junction, the connection with Israel's routes will be regulated, then it will be possible to cancel the existing connection by providing for a permanent repair to that road, which actually becomes a type of agricultural road with special instructions. The existing physical, but we are currently asking for relief from TMA / 3 mainly because of the distance from your national highway. Not a new connection. Less than 40 meters from a national road should receive relief under the authority of the district committee. Actually, I am talking about this arm. I am connecting with a new road. This means that the road that actually exists in the field is not statutory. I agree with the definition of the road at the moment, you will determine the rule of the road here, which is actually a road not only for the establishment but also for the ongoing maintenance of the site, less existing than the national road. In this small section, it is connected on the ground. It is not statutory, that is, I define it as an agricultural road, with special instructions Previously, Netibi Israel did not say this connection was approved. All they asked for was to reduce the number of connections as much as possible. This is a statement by Netibi Israel that is actually trying to stay with an existing connection as much as possible which is given in new connections. There is no additional connection of the axis like this, first of all, some of the considerations have passed, I'm not saying that this is all the considerations, but some. If - we will deal with firefighting. Part of the considerations in canceling some of the turbines in the Zodiac plan is also the proximity to the settlements. I'll just point out before that, within the framework of the review documents, the first alternative submitted by Zodiac included turbines that are close to the groves. Adjacent to Mount Halutz. These turbines were dropped from the plan. When the consideration was also a consideration of firefighting. Guidelines for firefighting, at least current guidelines for extinguishing from the air, speak of a range of hundreds of meters. Not of a kilometer or more. In order that, in order for a plane to pass. And of course there is a separate reference to natural forest and agriculturally cultivated land. Agriculturally cultivated land is obviously less sensitive to the issue of fires. We are talking about agriculturally cultivated land. These areas are very far away Meshavi, at least in terms of aerial firefighting. According to the current guidelines, these guidelines have not been closed to the end According to the current guidelines - and not according to the guidelines - we talked about the issue of distances - what other issues do the district committees have? The legal hearing if and when the approvals will be presented. A plan is not submitted at all in an environmental impact review before there is approval from RTA and the Ministry of Defense. This is not only a matter of compliance with the provisions of the TMA, it is also a matter of the expectations of entrepreneurs. We do not introduce entrepreneurs to the adventure of investing huge sums of money in promoting a plan for wind turbines that has no purpose at all. As long as the approval rule according to the instructions of the TMA A, no - they were submitted to the planning office in the district committee, the plan is not launched at all. A great many plans did not get off the ground because approvals from RTA and the Ministry of Defense were not received. So the process started in an orderly manner. Now the whole statement regarding the Ministry of Defense is a matter of disagreement regarding a general statement by the Ministry of Defense. A general statement really started two years ago. We do not promote a program that does not have a specific approval regarding lunch. The program is not promoted and the representative of the Ministry of Defense in the district committee can testify to that. which actually does not exist, - for which the technological solution has not yet been achieved. These statements come up in every discussion and are kept for the record. This thing is not swept under the carpet, these things are visible and present in every discussion. From this point of view, here are covered and again the claims as individual and general claims I assume will be filed in due time in the proper place. After exhausting all the planning and construction procedures that have not yet been exhausted. I mention that too. We are not in the process of objections, there is a plan here that has not yet been deposited. All claims that these claims will be examined will be answered. As long as there is no answer, I assume there will be a decision for them. Everything will be tested. We do not hide anything from the public",0,0,0,0,1,Support,0,"The statement reflects a cautious approach to the wind turbine project, emphasizing adherence to regulatory processes and the need for approvals from various authorities before proceeding. The speaker highlights the importance of following guidelines, obtaining necessary approvals from entities like the RTA and the Ministry of Defense, and ensuring that all environmental and legal concerns are addressed transparently. The focus on procedural correctness and the mention of not advancing the project without necessary approvals suggest a commitment to compliance and thorough review rather than outright support or opposition to the project itself.

Our general approach was that wind turbines should be approved. Even today, by the way, in coordination with the districts, the plans are going to a threshold test in Ramat Nechanch.

Even what was said is true two years ago, a sweeping letter was issued regarding all the turbine plans, all in full view, we all need to stop, so I'll run through the reference so as not to bore you. We support renewable energy processes. Wind turbine plans create a significant difficulty that requires a solution, there is no dispute about that. The completion process of addressing the gaps will take years. Coordinations were made in the past regarding the plans and the security establishment believed that the plans could be promoted. See entry n. At the same time, for security issues. In light of understanding that there will be an answer to the gap. You have told us recently for a year that there is currently no process that brings us to a solution. This process is stuck. We moved to work in Tor.

We will oppose the granting of a permit without this solution. It is not right to mislead the developer and the public and it is right to put things as they are.

First of all, Enlight's project is not in Meshgav. OK? So, okay. Anyone can come, contrary to the achievement of my members, there is a RTA approval in the program, approval in the district committee's file. Therefore, the district committee absolutely did not allow itself to deviate from the instructions of the TMA, the same as above regarding the approval of the Ministry of Defense. There is a written approval of the Ministry of Defense, for the location The turbines. That's why the district committee acted in accordance with the plan's instructions. This is not new. The Ministry of Defense has not accepted this position so far. Not the Hotal which approved TMA/42 and Subtal/78. Other programs too. Therefore, one should not confuse approval, which is required according to the TMA and is given, and the Ministry of Defense's objection in principle to turbine plans not being approved, not because of (unclear) a specific one or another, but because of the need to find a general solution.

The fire authorities have set guidelines in the past and will set guidelines in the future, what the fire authorities will set is what will be carried out in any case.

In fact, it is important to emphasize that this is not always the case, it is about two separate programs. - Two separate companies. (Unclear) The entire planning process is not connected and there is no connection between them except for the area where they are located. Our Ruh Kasra plan No. 0220814 255 I will present briefly I will quickly go through the presentation. Planning processes in the committee began in 2015. In January 2019 a decision was made in the district committee Submit the plan - which, according to the committee's decision, includes 4 wind turbines. The purpose of the discussion here today is the original approval - turbines on agricultural land (unclear) is declared. Approval of the construction of the project in an integrated area. According to Section 6.1.3 B - TMA / 35. And approval for Road 854 in TMA / 3. Enlight, a company that operates both in Israel and in the world, has established solar projects on the site. It has approved wind projects in Israel, including the large project that was built today in the Baka Valley. The construction has begun. In total, they are building 220 in the world 7 projects, 300,000 megawatts. As a result, it has a conditional license for 4 megawatts There will be more than 50 houses, which is around 9 thousand households. The height of the turbine will reach up to 200 meters. Areas that will soon be seen to be quite an area quite violated in terms of the areas. In terms of project components, we actually have 4 turbines here. All the collection networks are built, for this project this project will not include a substation but a connection to the electric company. Which means that all two turbines will be connected to a connection point of the electric company. From there they will go out on an infrastructure line of the electric company to five existing substations in the area. Why did we choose this area? Because actually you can see once the dead is an excellent area for the spirit. The wind speed there ranges from 6 to 7 meters per second. - Council wind speed. That's why it's an excellent area for wind on any national scale. My world as far as we are concerned. In terms of the project, a statutory background. In this project, part of the inter-ministerial team, it was submitted to the inter-ministerial team that it is important to see the complex marked by the team's recommendations approved by the national council. It was also chosen, among other things, because of the lands there. In the end, promoting a project requires an affinity for the land. There are private plot owners there. who in good faith set up their entire infrastructure. Regarding the construction there according to the detailed plans - you can see it also according to the land survey and according to the approved construction, in the area there is an industrial park in Kasra, mostly (unclear) extents in terms of the area. It is important to note that Our entire project is in the area of ​​jurisdiction of Kasra and part of it. A very small part is in Ma'ale Yosef. And areas for development 9 in the district committee which are given a lot of weight in the decision of the committee for construction according to the TAM/2 of the plan. The purple line shows the preservation of the area, at least from sensitive uses. In the area I will see all the approved and existing infrastructures. In the end, there are areas for mining and quarrying that are located south of the project Nature Reserve and Forestry. According to TMA / TMA / 35, there is a valley that is considered an open area according to detailed plans. There are also no slopes Below. Road 854 which is shown here in the heat actually covered the project. There is also an overhead line of the electric company, which crosses our area with , in terms of turbines - this plan started with 11 turbines Breeze. This is the location of the wind turbines. When two turbines went down due to proximity to an overhead power line of the electric company. 3 turbines came down in accordance with the agreements with the Kasra local council. on the basis of which she also in the end gave the approval for this project in the first place. Turbine 7 went down - in accordance with the agreements with the Zodiac company in the decision of the district committee. Turbine 11 recently came up in the discussion - of the district committee for depositing the plan. So we were left with 4 wind turbines. This is how it looks 4 wind turbines with 40 percent of the original project in the end. At the end of the 4 wind turbines will produce more energy than 22 turbines - - erected in Sirin and Gibloa. This is what the proposed state of the project looks like. Basically you see the access roads to the organizing area, to the turbines. When the episode of anchoring is actually about the turbines, decisions (unclear) in Israel__ decisions that all the turbines will enter the area of ​​the plan. They will also allow flexibility, approving the plan will basically allow maximum flexibility from a technological point of view. In accordance with this situation, the turbines are actually in an integrated protected structure, therefore also requiring the 9 agricultural area approval. In terms of uses, in the end, only / for a matter close to the wall. Here the turbines are background TMM / 2 to explain that (it is not clear) these are 4 turbines, two electrical rooms. One near turbine No. 3 One near turbine No. 5. At the end of which, only the mast will be erected. The total area of ​​the plan is 57. Regarding the turbines and the mast, the turbines will occupy about 1.8 dunams. 1.8 electrical rooms and in fact this is all after - - - restoration after bringing the turbines to the site, once the site starts occupying a total of about 18 dunams. This is a plan of 20 dunams. If we make it equivalent to solar, for example, 200 dunams In the project compared to solar compared to more. In terms of distances from the settlements we are both from approved, existing plans, also for existing construction, at the smallest distance (157 meters from Kasra). And 1059 meters from the blue line, I'm talking about the torches of what is found - there (unclear) no residences. So the plan is over 1000 meters from sensitive uses. Sensitive uses today it really is (unclear). In terms of access roads to the project and connection to a national road TMA / 3 So again, this is what it actually looks like A road cut for the project. Consists of a partial road which is actually a temporary road for the construction period after which it will be reconstructed as shown in the plan, and roads for the operating period. When the actual use during the operating period is minor. Because a turbine does not require much maintenance. The maintenance is marginal in relation to the technology itself and usage time for the project period. Most of the roads are after construction, all the roads that are not required will be restored. will return to their previous state. We planned the project, most of which will be based on existing dirt roads, which are used by the existing farmers. The existing roads up to the 5 meter limit. All roads and temporary extensions in favor of the original turbines, again for the construction period only, after which they will be restored. Both for the purpose of the support and from the journey we will use an existing landscape of terraces. Actually we have 4 connections to route 854, two temporary connections, you can see them in red, two permanent connections during the activation period. There is no other option, in terms of connections. It's the only way there is. Temporary connections again because this is an element that requires access to lower it to the turbine. Therefore, each turbine must have a suitable access road that at the end of the construction period will be restored and return to its previous state. Again, actually emphasizing the connections, there is also the committee's decision regarding access roads and restoration. We also in light of Dror's position, we think it is right to adopt it, in the end the fixed access roads will be marked as an easement and not a road. Also because as soon as it is marked as a road, it imposes difficulties with the Electricity Authority in relation to the infrastructures that can be moved on the road, therefore we ask that the roads here be marked with pleasure affinities. And it is important to note regarding the organizing area itself, that the organizing area itself is not connected to road 854. It will be connected to roads, you can see it here in yellow, existing dirt roads. The access to it will be from there and not through the road so as not to create a situation where there is any intersection or connections to the access road. Because in the end you have to ensure yourself mainly in this area, any area that you will have access to turbines. If there is any malfunction, you need to get to the turbine. You guarantee access. The only approach is possible and because there is a valley separating the 4 turbines, the possible approach is actually the only way to produce an approach for every 2 turbines. Just in case something happens. I must guarantee access. Mr. Tamir Chazot: The slopes there are also quite sharp. Therefore it is impossible to connect. We were happy. We are happy - always to produce as few access ways as possible. But in the end the area does not allow it. In terms of the connection to ways of access, what is important for you to see here in the end, is that we cannot rely on the same ways of access. This is in front of the other project. Basically our project, which is the blue one, is north of the 854 road and the Zodiac project is south of the 854. Therefore the connections cannot and cannot be the same connections in the end. In terms of landscape in the end wind turbines are an element in the end that will be observed in the landscape. Some will argue that it is not suitable, some will argue that it is very suitable for the landscape. This is a subjective position. In the end, this whole area and our project can be seen in the visualization. He will not be seen. There are nature reserves that will see it. In the end there are 3 main nature sites where the turbines will be visible in the landscape. This is a mountain (unclear) Beit Hamemek stream reserve and a reserve (unclear). The main road from which the turbines will be seen in the end is road 854. From road 864 there are almost no views. In the survey they also referred to turbine 11 and 7, but both were dropped from the plan. Just to show that, for example, from Deir al-Assad to get a perspective. 5 km away from Deir Asad, you don't see the turbines. It just hides their appearance. Of course, we conducted a survey in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, after the survey, we reached an agreement with the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The survey was conducted on 67 birds and 50 percent of the total number of birds passed through the risk area. And the Ministry - for Environmental Protection and RTG saw that this risk model ultimately indicated almost the same values ​​in relation to damage during the day. Regarding the estimate at night, a total of 178,000 birds were observed at night at a level of risk. In the end - - - our risk estimate at night and during the day shows Impact of 4 migratory birds per year. The Northern District Committee has set quite clear threshold values. In our opinion, in relation to other turbines we have stricter standards. And of course us, these are instructions given and incorporated into the plan's instructions, and of course we will undertake to submit a monitoring plan - and we will represent an operating regime for the building permit period. We will meet threshold values. From the point of view of the Ministry of Defense, what was said in the entire discussion. In the end this project was approved by the army and we have a letter on the matter. Regarding 11 locations of turbines. - The turbines ¼ j_______ Of course in the end it is 40 percent of the total program approved by the Ministry of Defense. We hear - this position in every discussion we do. Also programs that have been approved for validity. Ultimately, it stems from the Ministry of Defense's requirement to complete the financial aspect of implementing wind turbine technology solutions. This issue is in negotiations, in our opinion, which we hear is very advanced with the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Defense. Of course, the budget department is involved in this.

I have been involved in planning and construction for 30 years, 25 years ago I recommended to the Minister of the Interior lol I am currently serving as the head of the Mashgav Regional Council. To a large extent, I came to this discussion as a representative of other authorities, including Kasra Samia. Including Yanoch Gat. The current heads of the council are opposed for this program and participated in the discussion in the district committee.

I am 62 years old, so I deal with fires at least 10 times every summer? I draw your attention to those who can It is related to it professionally and those who are less related to it that beyond the fact that the world is changing, and the climate is changing, there are different sensitivities to fires in different areas that he has an influence, I sat on the district committee. This is about Har Halutz, which we have already cleared. because they had already stopped the fire there at the threshold of the houses. We are talking about deaf people in terms of the focus of firefighting, which is defined as the most dangerous that can be in the country. We are engaged in a field that develops and changes. It develops and changes and it changes differently in different places in the country. Now I ask for your attention for a moment because, among other things, one of my sons who is a pilot in the Air Force almost died fighting a fire and he was seriously injured and the issue is getting worse. The whole concept of firefighting has changed. In the years we are discussing the program. They became fire fighters who 6 years ago would not have come in to take care of this thing, and today they do. The concept of fighting fire has also changed. They spoke here from the Ministry of Defense, they did not speak here from the fire services, and as far as the fire services are concerned, they are undergoing a revolution in terms of concept and everything. We put out the fire both in the plows and in Har Halutz, also only thanks to the planes. Only thanks to the planes. This is relevant. I know that it will take 20 years to turn it off. How does it affect that? I know from hard personal experience that turbines affect the ability of firefighting to arrive. The Nature and Parks Authority is prevented for legal reasons from saying that 200 meters is - influential, I feel as a public representative, I tell you as various public representatives that 200 meters is knocking the reserve - because of firefighting and not because it is in the reserve itself.

First of all, the same letter that arrived during the last few weeks, - to the second entrepreneur to Enlight, actually refers to all the farms as a whole. That is, he also mentions the southern farm, a place that should be downplayed as much as possible in new compositions. The extension does not actually offer a new connection. There is an approved interchange here by virtue of an approved program. So now, as much as it is possible to connect to this arm then we can. There is a successful login here. In practice, there is an agricultural road that connects, this interchange does not physically exist in the field. There is an agricultural road here that connects to the existing road. So both solutions exist. As long as the solution is not established, it does not exist, then it will not be possible to connect to it, the connection will be a connection to the existing road. As long as this interchange is developed as a junction, the connection with Israel's routes will be regulated, then it will be possible to cancel the existing connection by providing for a permanent repair to that road, which actually becomes a type of agricultural road with special instructions. The existing physical, but we are currently asking for relief from TMA / 3 mainly because of the distance from your national highway. Not a new connection. Less than 40 meters from a national road should receive relief under the authority of the district committee. Actually, I am talking about this arm. I am connecting with a new road. This means that the road that actually exists in the field is not statutory. I agree with the definition of the road at the moment, you will determine the rule of the road here, which is actually a road not only for the establishment but also for the ongoing maintenance of the site, less existing than the national road. In this small section, it is connected on the ground. It is not statutory, that is, I define it as an agricultural road, with special instructions Previously, Netibi Israel did not say this connection was approved. All they asked for was to reduce the number of connections as much as possible. This is a statement by Netibi Israel that is actually trying to stay with an existing connection as much as possible which is given in new connections. There is no additional connection of the axis like this, first of all, some of the considerations have passed, I'm not saying that this is all the considerations, but some. If - we will deal with firefighting. Part of the considerations in canceling some of the turbines in the Zodiac plan is also the proximity to the settlements. I'll just point out before that, within the framework of the review documents, the first alternative submitted by Zodiac included turbines that are close to the groves. Adjacent to Mount Halutz. These turbines were dropped from the plan. When the consideration was also a consideration of firefighting. Guidelines for firefighting, at least current guidelines for extinguishing from the air, speak of a range of hundreds of meters. Not of a kilometer or more. In order that, in order for a plane to pass. And of course there is a separate reference to natural forest and agriculturally cultivated land. Agriculturally cultivated land is obviously less sensitive to the issue of fires. We are talking about agriculturally cultivated land. These areas are very far away Meshavi, at least in terms of aerial firefighting. According to the current guidelines, these guidelines have not been closed to the end According to the current guidelines - and not according to the guidelines - we talked about the issue of distances - what other issues do the district committees have? The legal hearing if and when the approvals will be presented. A plan is not submitted at all in an environmental impact review before there is approval from RTA and the Ministry of Defense. This is not only a matter of compliance with the provisions of the TMA, it is also a matter of the expectations of entrepreneurs. We do not introduce entrepreneurs to the adventure of investing huge sums of money in promoting a plan for wind turbines that has no purpose at all. As long as the approval rule according to the instructions of the TMA A, no - they were submitted to the planning office in the district committee, the plan is not launched at all. A great many plans did not get off the ground because approvals from RTA and the Ministry of Defense were not received. So the process started in an orderly manner. Now the whole statement regarding the Ministry of Defense is a matter of disagreement regarding a general statement by the Ministry of Defense. A general statement really started two years ago. We do not promote a program that does not have a specific approval regarding lunch. The program is not promoted and the representative of the Ministry of Defense in the district committee can testify to that. which actually does not exist, - for which the technological solution has not yet been achieved. These statements come up in every discussion and are kept for the record. This thing is not swept under the carpet, these things are visible and present in every discussion. From this point of view, here are covered and again the claims as individual and general claims I assume will be filed in due time in the proper place. After exhausting all the planning and construction procedures that have not yet been exhausted. I mention that too. We are not in the process of objections, there is a plan here that has not yet been deposited. All claims that these claims will be examined will be answered.

The state has really invested a lot in order for us to be able to advance the plan, whether it is by determining with a sweeping unanimous agreement in TMA 41 how the turbines can be promoted, whether it is through agreements with the Ministry of Defense, or whether it is really an attempt to locate by broad agreement areas that they agree to promote turbines.

Because they realized that in fact there is more knowledge that needs to be accumulated and hazards that can happen Now, the question is whether it's really happening. We talked to people in the Golan Heights, they tell us that standing under the turbines is borderline impossible. It turns out that it's not just the noise we're on We talked about it is one of the factors that make it very difficult for the worker in the field, there is the matter of shading. Clothing for the flickering that appears in the sun behind the blades, the shading is all the time, and to stand there under the turbine and have this shadow rotate all the time, is probably impossible, so the claim that I I have to say, at first glance it sounded correct and logical, so the claim that it is possible (unclear) to have a distance to the turbines is the advantage of the turbines, at the very least I would say needs to be tested, because it turns out that, as the local Gilboa committee realized, there are other consequences - that we probably don't We understand and it would be right to wait, to see the consequences over a reasonable period of time of the existing farm in the Weeping Valley and to learn from it.

I would like to add two things, we have already done this once before, we have already presented it, but I am not sure that everyone was, so I want to repeat the issue that is troubling us regarding the farm, and then also read a letter sent by the Society for the Protection of Nature, that they are prevented from being here at the discussion . But it relates to all the issues and also to the proposed resolution that will come up in the discussion. So if we are talking about two complexes, this is not the correct layout of the turbines, it is the previous versions but it illustrates the finding that we recommended in our opinion. There are two complexes here. We have the central complex which is an extortion complex. where most of the turbines are located. There are currently 32 turbines here. We have the complex - 31. We have the Ravana complex, which is this area that currently has 7 turbines. Why are we actually opposed to the Ravana complex? OK. The ecologist and I. The environmental team of - , of the program. The Ravana complex sits within an area. If we look at the nature reserves in the area, then there is indeed an enclave here, but if you look at this entire area, it is the area of ​​Odem Forest and the whole of it is a very - very valuable area that the complex itself is located within some sort of agricultural enclave which is within this area. To the north of the compound, there is the entire area of ​​the proposed Nahal Sahar reserve. Again we see that there really remains this enclosed section but within the area I'm sure you all know the Odem forest and it is one of the only two real forests in the country and an area that is exceptionally valuable. If we continue to look at both the reserves that are defined in TMA, and also at the reserves that are defined in TMA / 8, then we see that this whole area is really taking advantage of a small area, but the area is really a valuable and special area. How he should preserve it. And TMA / 22 marked the area itself within the area which is a polygon. But if you look at this whole place in this aspect, this area is special. But if we look at it a little wider to the east and I look at the area of ​​road 98 which leads from south to north and actually crosses the area of ​​the turbines which is really on the border and on the side and is on the fringes. I know that Ram has other considerations but for us, he is in a place where I say ok, on one side there is a concentration of turbines we know how to live with them Less harmful in terms of their damage to the winged ones, which we will see later, because the damage of each turbine here is 12 and a half times greater than the potential of the turbines here. So we can live with this area. If we go another 3 and a half 4 km south, We will see that the entire southern region is the area of ​​the Emek Baqa project. I mean, there will be a very large concentration of turbines here, there will be a very large concentration of turbines here, and I don't know what will happen next, but I say that this area is the views of those who are on the Golan Heights and looking towards the Galilee looking towards if they have an angle of vision, The valley of the mohole can be kept this place clean. To keep this place as a place of natural values ​​and a place of high sensitivity and not - , and not - , I don't want - , keep the development of the turbines on one side, keep the other side for our children and our grandchildren. There will also be things beyond the immediate need. There is a big farm here. A farm of 1 3 mega turbines is a farm that would be large by any standard. This is a point that is big and gives pleasant and nice profits to entrepreneurs. I think even stopping here is enough here. Don't need the whole area. It can also be left for other needs that the residents have. And not just to generate electricity. It's also clean electricity. I say the clean with a little tremor in my voice. Regarding the winged survey, I want to first read the letter from the Society for the Protection of Nature, who asked us to read it as a discussion, they are not allowed to participate, so it's a bit long, so please be patient. Disturbing findings of damage to birds of prey in the wind farms in Sirin are discussed. For several weeks we have been witnessing disturbing efforts to harm birds of prey at the wind turbine farm in Ramat Sirin. About a month ago, he arrived at the animal hospital because he was found with an injured wing near the turbines, and he was euthanized by ending his suffering. Not a month passed and another pen heel was found in a similar situation and so was the fate of a second pen heel. This. In addition, we have evidence of many carcasses of birds of prey near the wind farm. All from the last few months. We would add and note that another disturbing aspect in this context is that all of the affected birds were not found by the wind farm operators who are responsible for the monitoring but by farmers who worked nearby. We have been warning for a number of years that the construction of turbines in Israel could result in serious injuries to winged animals. Birds and bats. The authorities and the entrepreneurs solved this by saying that there really is no vulnerability and later began to say that even if there is a danger of vulnerability it can be dealt with through monitoring and operating regimes. We are no longer at the stage of theoretical discussions, as a result of the farm's activity in Sirin, there are extremely serious injuries. Unfortunately, the fear of severely harming the birds turned out to be justified. We note that even in the Gilboa wind farm, injuries to the birds were found that are far beyond what was predicted during the approval stages of the plan. Moreover, these two wind farms are located in an area that is not defined or known to be particularly sensitive in terms of winged animals. Therefore, these findings are especially worrying. Moreover, even though the operating condition for the operation of the wind farm according to the plan was the performance of monitoring by the developer, by the developer, the farm operated for a number of months before the beginning of the monitoring, the monitoring was carried out not according to RTAG instructions and no report was published Monitoring. Currently there is no monitoring at the farm. The developer claims that it is only for one year. Therefore, the planning institutions and the environmental protection authorities do not know the extent of the damage with which we opened the letter and were based on the findings of the active farmers. In the area, the hotel's ecological consultant himself stated that the quality of the monitoring carried out in Sirin and Gilboa was poor. The issue of the operation of the quality monitoring system Amin Sedor and BDepending on it, the approval of plans for wind farms is being limed and they are critical as they are the basis for understanding the extent of the damage. As a result, the introduction of required changes in the operating regime to prevent accidental licenses. Here already in the upcoming discussion that will be held on Monday today, (it is not clear) the developer exempted himself from the need to carry out an operating regime except after the monitoring. This is, among other things, based on the poor monitoring in Sirin. This evidence obliges the entire system to draw conclusions and the committee that the construction of wind turbines in Israel will not cause ecological damage. Lutal has a lot of responsibility in this matter since 4 huge farms of turbines are promoted on its table. 47, it also includes 78, 76 and 77. In light of this, we request these things - first, that this letter be brought before the members of the committee. We are doing it. There is Consider seriously the impact on the environment and in particular the details dealing with damage to the animals. In cases where there is a fear of serious damage to the nature, the monitoring limitations must be recognized, including the understanding that it is not possible to locate all the carcasses and its results will always be deficient in relation to the extent of the damage The analysis methods that RTAG require are based on experience in the world. Long-term monitoring should be required in approved farms. It is necessary to demand that the monitoring be carried out according to a RTG document for the matter that was recently issued. It is necessary to demand that the monitoring be carried out by a RTG funded by the developer. Monitoring should not be left to the developer. The integration of operating regimes must be required from the day of the first operation of each approved farm, and an effective mechanism must be integrated to carry out changes in the operating regime in accordance with the monitoring plans. In particular, it must be determined that injuries that are defined as severe will be accompanied by the halting of the farm's activity until a review is conducted and its conclusions are implemented. Sirin Farm, the findings on its territory indicate damage to the territory. It has nothing to do with us Sirin Farm at the moment. If this is how I summarize what we are - , both the letter and what I saw here, our recommendation is to quietly leave the Ravana compound and focus on the area of ​​extortion, which is the more active area. This request is also supported by the North District which takes the same position. If I understand correctly, Vared will also talk about the comprehensive plans that exist in these areas. Regarding the operating regime to have an operating regime that we define in two stages. Even in the phase of activation and - later in the phase of monitoring the restoration of an accompanying team that will make sure that things are done here properly. And if we see, we try to get out here in an easier way than in Tel - Peres. There are no eagles here. We only decided to do it during the migration season and not throughout the year. It is possible that later the control team will say that they will be allowed to be exempted at all. They might say that it should be done all year round. We don't know how it will turn out. But you have to say ok - ok you can set up but you also have to take into account the risks from this place. According to RTG's threshold values ​​document.

The speaker emphasizes the need for rigorous and long-term monitoring, adherence to specific guidelines issued by RTG, and the implementation of operating regimes that can be adjusted based on monitoring results. The speaker also suggests that the project's approval should be contingent on these stringent conditions and highlights the inadequacies of current monitoring efforts, suggesting that they may underestimate the actual damage. The mention of halting the farm's activity in case of severe injuries indicates a strong precautionary approach.

I want I want to refer to some of the things and I want to perhaps make some sort of summary as representing the issue of electricity production with renewable energy. You can say no at any cost, you can say. But this program has been going on for 10 years. It started about 80 turbines, it passed the approval of the Ministry of Defense and received the approval of Ram. We are currently in advanced negotiations with the Ministry of Defense, we have already transferred 3 thousand additional data to the Ministry of Defense as well. This program passed all the tests. I was convinced by something that Eyal presented, on the subject of that polygon - Ms. Dorit Hochner: We forwarded the data to the Ministry of Defense, an agreement is currently being formed. There is a framework of agreements. There are agreements between the CEOs on the same framework. At the moment, it is taking shape. It is not finished and there is still much work to be done. about that. These 42 turbines that were here, of which 4 were taken down following agreements with the security system, have already cut this project, no one is obligated to comply with the license. The 80 turbines were not related to the license, but there is no doubt that the developer wants to maximize and we also want to maximize. You are already setting up a project. Now always in Butal - , I listened to you Nahum. I listened to you. Always in Butal we deserve the permanent conflict on the issue of infrastructure, that's why we come to the committee for infrastructure. The conflict between human life / inclusive outline plans and proximity of projects to people, and green areas. We always end up in this place. That means there should be balance in this matter as well. Now if we take down Ravana the same compound that is relatively far from the areas where people live. We are under the constraints of wind speed because in other places you don't have offers for such a project at all, in terms of wind speed. So we also need these 7 turbines, which, as we saw before, were also cut down by many, many tests of one kind or another. So once again, the issue of the power in the license is not the reasoning why it is being promoted. We want to promote reaching the goals set by the government. that you are looking at carcasses and we do not belittle it, on the contrary we respect and the entrepreneurs also offered all kinds of things in this matter. We are looking at the issue of creating clean air in the mix that allows the supply of electricity unlike what we have here every few minutes. Right. That's why we see the balances are maintained in 38 turbines. Regarding heads of authorities, I must say that we also see this in other projects. I mean, what I want to say is that we don't have anything new here in this specific project compared to other projects in Tel Aviv. That's why we believe, I agree, that an operating regime should be imposed on this project. The developer agreed. We accept that there is a sensitive area here, so you showed us very Nice, but the area where Ravana is located. We know that you also have wind turbines in other places, especially in the south. We are also trying to find the balances here between the plans that live in them or the plans that have inclusive plans We would like to move forward with this project as it is currently being brought to Lothal after so many years and so many tests.

These 3 plans are actually expected to be discussed in the district in about two months. We have already brought documents. Basically, as it was said here, it was very difficult, there was a great effort to find areas to erect turbines, so in the same way it was also very difficult for us to find areas required for the expansion of the settlements. There are a lot of limitations here, this is also something I said in a previous discussion, a lot of limitations in terms of areas - open areas. Nature reserves, infrastructure, and areas where the settlements could be expanded, were very limited. The heads of the authorities and everyone we heard who sat down with the settlements, we talked about the need to expand the settlements, and also in the 25-30 year range that we are actually targeting the plan for this period. I want to support what Eyal really said, in the recommendation of the environmental consultant, the ecologist and other representatives we heard. These plans place a great deal of emphasis on the development of tourism, and the settlements' reliance on tourism, and we also express concern about the location of the Ravana complex. which is close to Nahal Sahar, Yaer Odem and other coveted rights that are here in the area and that attract tourism. Regarding the extortion complex, extortion? I remember that in the past there was also talk about turbine 87 which is the upper one next to the canceled turbine, is that also true? Up on the west side. exactly. We also have some concern about this turbine, it is approaching the area of ​​vibration and we request that it be examined in a review to see that there really is no effect there. Yes. Fine. its effect on the Rihan neighborhood in the Shams tower which expands the south tower. In Barakat Ram we are in the northwestern part of the barakah designating this area for tourism, again we want the survey to make sure that the eastern turbines - sorry, the western turbines - do not affect this area. Yes. But it should be seen that there is no effect there beyond the scenic effect. One last thing, we really heard in the previous discussion mainly the representatives of land owners and not so much - the voices of the heads of authorities and the voices we hear in the programs are heard. And the heads of authorities have really changed there recently, except for Migdal. We think that it is certainly appropriate to hear their voices as well. Mainly, fear of vibration damage. And we are talking about really the scenic matter and the entire agricultural area that - about extortion, yes? There were voices talking about the agricultural area and the cultivation of the land, which we also heard from the developers that there is no harm in cultivating the land.",1,0,0,1,1,Neutral,-0.5,"The statement reflects concerns about the potential impacts of wind turbine installations, particularly regarding their effects on local tourism, scenic views, and agricultural activities.

Today we are already in 2019, the government has decided to update the electricity generation mix with renewable energies as it exists in many advanced countries throughout Europe and the entire world. We want to reach the quota of how much is it? 800 megawatts? I don't remember exactly. ?730 in spirit. Now, unfortunately, until today, apart from the achievement we had a few months ago when we approved the 42 turbines that give something like 100 megawatts. Almost 200, we still remain very far from the government's decision. Even further than Sweden. That's where they approved the 4,000 turbine a few days ago. I can tell you that I checked and saw that in Egypt they built an array of turbines. So in Ram's favor we will start with the turbines in Egypt where, with the support of the Egyptian security system, it was approved there. In Costa Rica 100 percent of the energy is renewable energy. Here we are slowly progressing towards a government decision that, as we discussed, Ram is from October 2014 to reach 730 megawatts. We are just at the beginning.

So I mention, this is the background. This plan actually includes two polygons of turbines. The large eastern main polygon called the Extortion Complex. . currently includes 31 turbines. And a more western polygon called the Ravana complex which includes 7 turbines, in total - 38 in total - soon - soon. We will see you compared to what was before. OK. I advocate data from the entrepreneur. They were introduced in a previous discussion. What were his considerations in the layout of the turbines. I mention that actually finding locations for turbines in the country, no - , is not easy. First of all, let there be a spirit. After that there are security restrictions. There are distances between turbines and there are all kinds of engineering considerations and of course there are environmental considerations, both of observability and of those with wings and of distances from development. Probably optimal. OK. So about what was in the past. The entrepreneur started at the beginning, you see here with all the turbines he asked to build. All the red ones are rejected turbines. First - this whole line marks some kind of latitude that the security system even in previous stages set a limit. She said turbines cannot be erected south of this line. So all those turbines went down. All the turbines in this complex on the Nimrod ridge, the developer took down at our request. Because it's a highly viewed site - very widely. Also very close to the settlement but also from a scenic point of view it was perceived as unbearable. He took it down. So the committee got these two complexes. moment. What happened? Ms. Little Yedin: Oh, ok. So now we will see the changes compared to what was in the previous discussion. After that in -, in -, at a stage I don't remember, - on which date, maybe Ram remembers, the developer received approval from the security system for 42 OK. So he got permission to have a written document from the security system. They literally tested turbine turbine and approved 42 of them. Part - , part the developer the developer part downloaded. There are 12 red turbines left that the security establishment said it still does not approve. Still needs testing. This - , this was in a previous discussion. In the meantime, since, as Shanva and Ze'ev said, the security establishment delayed with its position, the circumstances changed. Ram will elaborate on this. The developer decided that he is not waiting for the approval of the 12 turbines, he is moving forward with the 42. which he received approval for. Oh, this is the document that - , from October Chaim said he approved the 42 turbines. In addition, after 42 turbines, another 4 turbines went down. 2 The developer took it down because after additional tests he did he said the wind data was not good. Another 2 he took down following our demands, one you see here that was too close to the settlement. There was a problem with jitter. And another second here in the Ravana complex. So now we have stayed here 7 times. Speaker: Why is there an orange one here? Ms. Lital Yadin: The developer took it down because of his considerations that - he didn't have good wind data. Okay, so actually from the developer's point of view, the instructions that have now been uploaded to the system, compared to what was before, actually express the reduction of the 4 turbines that went down. This is reflected in the area of ​​the plan in the number of blocks and plots in the number of turbines and so on. You see here the updated blue line. These are all the turbines that he took down here in this complex, the ones that were also taken down due to considerations of the 12th that were not approved by the security establishment. And also his considerations in terms of spirit. here also. So the previous blue line is what a dashed white line is. OK. So it's a reduction of the blue line. There is also a reduction here. The reduction of the turbines also slightly reduces the areas of access roads to each of the turbines. The blue line updated all appendices accordingly. That's it, this is Hara's request.

Here is a classic example from my point of view of social values ​​in planning, between social values ​​at a national level and social values ​​at a local level. On a national level, exactly what we talked about is a great destination. At a local level, a conflict arises between landowners and those who do not own land. Even in the previous discussion, some of the people who came to represent the residents, a - do not live there. No adults in the Golan. B - They also have a financial interest in the implementation of the project. I mean shares. So these things must be said. I think the balance, the groups that are always knocked out in planning processes are the ones that don't have a voice. Their economic capabilities are low and they also do not own land. And really, as was said before, in the context of the plans in the north, these plans, this plan, will put a very big limit on the development of the settlements. It will put a big limit on the cultivation of the land that is also done by people who are not land owners, and there is also a very big potential for damage to tourism.

I purposely do not like the word as someone who does public sharing does not like the word of public sharing. Because we each understand in a different way. Building a consensus among those people at a local level, among those people who enjoy because there are people who enjoy here. Local residents as a result of what you described earlier.

In general, this is also wind energy. But not at any cost. Each program should be examined on its own merits. I think the things that Eyal presented here are quite clear, especially against the background of the letter sent by the Society for the Protection of Nature from yesterday evening. I think the statement is clear and sharp. There is a significant danger here for those with wings. Winged birds that are in sensitive populations that are threatened to the point of extinction. This should be taken into account when making decisions. Don't just look at the overall policy. Last night I was considering how provocative to be in this discussion. Because yesterday 3 carcasses of birds of prey were brought to Jerusalem that were brought down yesterday evening from Mount Sirin. As I thought maybe it might be - , something like they do from time to time, members of the Knesset in the Knesset, but I decided to spare you the gruesome sight. The danger is clear. If we look at the results of the surveys, the results of the models and the opinions, we point to a relatively very - very large - risk. And Eyal explained at least in the southern complex, now the entire southern complex - , the western compared to the large complex, the difference here is very significant. The more we read the reports, we get the impression that there is also a fundamental lack in the preparation of the report itself. which concerns the local species. The establishment survey. But it is not completed. And in our opinion it is lacking and requires completion. I mention the Tel Peres case as soon as we postpone all these tests that should be on the table in the future of decision-making, postpone them to a late stage that is no longer before the public, at quite late stages where there is no longer any decision-making. The question is who will it serve? And I think in light of the data and in light of what Eyal said, we think it is necessary to adopt the recommendation of the professional team, also to lower the southern complex, the small complex and give it up. Apply an operating regime from day one including monitoring. And the position, or at least the position that was presented to us, not to give up this complex - in order to maintain an option in relation to the capacity stipulated in the license of the Electricity Authority, is a position that is completely unacceptable to us.

According to the developer, it is possible to minimize the impact of the turbines. There is no doubt that once the turbines are up, bird monitoring, noise monitoring, vibration monitoring, whatever is needed will begin. We asked him what measures he could take to reduce it and it turns out that it has an effect in terms of noise or vibration. He said that there is also a possibility to protect the turbine itself, there is some kind of cover that can reduce the noise. It is possible to control the speed of rotation of the blades. I say again. I quote Ram was what he said. I don't know these subjects. But he also said that there is a possibility to reduce the noise as well as to reduce the rotation speed. What is also important to note is that specifically for these outposts, we are talking about outposts that are inside the ground, they are protected by boulders. This is not an area that is an open camp with normal buildings. It's like they are stationed underground. It is the possibility that they will be harmed, it may exist, I am not familiar with health and things like that. But it is placed as most of us are familiar with boulders in the underground. They are protected. The soldiers will not see these turbines. As for whether they will hear them, I am not sure that they will also hear them with the white background or white noise or whatever they call it. The developer said that if monitoring is conducted and it is found that there really is damage in terms of noise and vibration, then he will take measures if necessary, then he will also shut down. But he says let's first - every monitor let's first check these things.

The entrepreneur makes a commitment in advance. So how do you say? I hope that the State of Israel will not be in a situation where we will need it. But if we also need days or weeks, or something, then obviously the good of the State of Israel - the security of the State of Israel is above all. We hope let's say most of the time these turbines will be running. Now, here we are talking about a total of 31 turbines, so it could be that 1 should be disabled and 1 should not be disabled. But as soon as a representative of the Ministry of Defense sits in the operating team, we solve the problem. Yes Elad? Mr. Zev (Zavik) Bielski - Chairman of the Committee for National Infrastructures: Let's move forward. We are total - you know, you can always not do anything uncomfortable and stand, wait for the coming of the Messiah, you know, then things will really progress. Today we are under these constraints, the State of Israel is a very crowded country. This morning we held a discussion with mayors regarding a power plant in the Sharon area to the south of Sharon. And of course no one wants it to be next to them and it will only be somewhere else. When you look at our narrow country, you know you don't have - , we are not inclined, certainly not in spirit and we are not quite limited. I told you last time I was in Denmark I saw 3700 turbines that provide over 100 percent of the energy consumption of this country. And on the days that they have excess energy, they have an arrangement with Norway and Sweden to transfer energy to them, they shut down stations and pay a small amount for the wind. That's how it should be. Now, we are in my poor and really poor strength, I'm trying already, you know how long I've been dreaming about turbines. See turbines. The only way to move forward is a little at a time. You know. It is of course that the Ministry of Defense is an important ministry, and for you all to be calm, our decision here is still subject to a government decision. Usually those who know the government, if not Tal can tell you, the Minister of Defense has a lot of influence in the government. Probably the current defense minister. So, yes. Yes. Talking among themselves they have decisions there. That is why no one, not the Israeli government, will approve a project that is against the security of the State of Israel. Them - , the same way that Ram is a way that guarantees us there are risks here that the developer takes. Once he agrees to what he agreed to. So he takes a risk. It might stop 3 turbines, it might be 10 turbines, it might be a month. No one knows. We are all trying to promote our country. And if we do, you know, today there is the danger of accurate missiles. I don't need to tell you. So today every national infrastructure is a danger. It doesn't matter where she says she is. There may be time and it happened two weeks ago that we were stationed. The army decided that it was not taking any risks and decided where it was headed. And that's why we are this whole country within the range of you precision missiles today. If someone wants and has the technological ability as well as this, then he can paralyze Hadera for us, he can paralyze the airport in Ramat David, he can paralyze 1001 things for us. The only thing that might be difficult for him is the trapped energy inside the ground. This in it will be a little difficult it. But we are in times like this, I hope they won't be as they say? Lehm has been enshrined throughout the year, if there is such a period, then without a doubt the IDF takes command. It decides. If all the turbines need to be shut down, all the turbines. In the operating team. We have two types here. I don't remember how much it started. You know She cooked porridge for the children in the end, so today we have reached a situation where we have 25 turbines that we received approval from RMI and 6 turbines that are under discussion at the Ministry of Justice. That's why we, together with what you coordinated -, what Ram described, we bring a resolution proposal that takes into account these 2 types of turbines. 25 with which there is no problem we will approve them and - 6 turbines that are still in the clear we will, as they say, approve conditionally. You will soon hear the proposed decision. . We will hang for a year to see if we progress for a year, which is good. If not, then we are left with 25 ram, let me tell you. I was a boy, I was also old, we just have to move forward. What's happening is very easy for us, the best thing is, believe me, dirt will be removed every day. We've got something going on here. Then I'll give you, I told you today, as much as you want. But I told you today, the Israeli government set a quota of 800 megawatts years ago. We're not even close. We are far from it.

We discussed the researcher's recommendations. The full committee decided to accept the recommendation of the sub-committee, to adopt the researcher's recommendations contained in the report subject to the amendments detailed in the decision. In relation to the achievement of the Israel Land Authority and the request of the Defense Minister's representative, the committee actually received the interim approval for another internal discussion to be held, which is today's discussion. In which it will re-examine the revised draft that will be submitted to it that meets the following conditions, so in regards to the 12 turbine locations that, according to the RMI, are located in state territories, the committee turned to the RMI and asked for clarification within 14 days. On the gap between the turbine locations that were included in the August 2018 approval and the turbine locations that were included in its achievement. Determined that after receiving Rami's reference, the planners will be deprived of the locations of the turbines that are not approved by it. In relation to the 12 turbines of Rami's permit committee. Sorry. Rami's permit committee approved. Sorry. Approved a smaller polygon for them than was included at all. So the decision was either the developer will reduce the polygons and resubmit them for Rami's approval or the permit committee will approve them and this also needs to submit a revised draft. And the committee determined that until this internal discussion, coordination will be carried out with the security system. In any case, a conditional license must be obtained from the Electricity Authority. So that's how what happened since the previous discussion was the following. First of all, the developer reduced those expanded polygons, submitted the reduction to RMI and we received a letter from RMI confirming the reduced polygons. A letter was also received from RMI saying that after they checked, they did another check, now there are 6 turbines left that are in dispute and are awaiting the Attorney General's decision. What was a polygon reduction is not land. It is not state land. They were originally approved, so the developer expanded. Expanded the polygons. Rami said in the discussion a moment. We confirmed the place that it is not on state land, now we have to see that the extension is also not on state land. So he reduced them. And they said ok - ok now after reduction it's not on state land. There are 6 turbines left that Rami claims are on state land. The developer disputes them but this is Rami's claim. And the legal advisor should decide on them. One more thing, okay. Another thing as mentioned was a decision that further coordination with the security system would be carried out. Indeed, further coordination was conducted. A document was also received from the security system. Ram will probably talk about it in more detail. But I will say in the meantime that this document stated that there are IDF camps for chapters that are up to 500 meters away from 11 wind turbines. One of them is on the same list as the 6 turbines on the lands. But it doesn't matter. And there are other camps up to 1000 meters away and also in the future , there may be changes in the layout of the camps. I mean, it may not be manned today, but it was made clear to the developer that as long as no solutions are found for these environmental problems, he may be forced to disable certain turbines Let's talk about it. Another thing, if you remember, was some kind of achievement by the electric company regarding their electricity company. They asked to divide it into cells - space. The recommendation to do it was accepted, but they had to submit some kind of division certificate. We received the division certificate from the developer. It was approved by the electric company. And they just asked -, -, to guarantee yes. This is all at the request of Rami. The distribution electric company is agreed upon. They asked to ensure that there would be a right of passage within the compartment - the area from one to the other. There was an area of ​​the electric authority that did approve the conditional license for the developer. Now it is awaiting the minister's signature. Another thing we received Clarification from the Nature and Parks Authority if you remember in a previous discussion during the discussion Eyal Klyder who is not here today asked at RTG's request to delete the term other species from the entire section of winged birds. But in the meantime, we received a clarification from Nir Engert from the Nature and Parks Authority, that since the previous discussion, some kind of agreed document regarding the threshold values ​​has been approved, so it drops from the requirement, and therefore we are returning the term of other species. So that's it now, I can show you. Threshold values ​​document of wing owners yes. We have here. We have now received the revised draft submitted by the developer with the 25 turbines. Good.

And the issue is not only the - the fact that the permits will take a very long time until they can issue them and be able to implement the plan, the point is that this plan, if it does not go into effect but is approved, it imposes very - very large limitations on everything that happens there in the area. Because the development alternatives in the area, both in terms of the settlements and the residents, are - they may constitute a very large factor in their development potential - of the settlements and of the households.

09/09/2019,תתל 47,NIC,Government,"Good. So this program is, in my opinion, our most complex program. It has consequences on several levels. Not every turbine scheme is similar to its sister. We were originally opposed to all the plans for the turbines I mention forgotten. We opposed any turbine plans because of their impact on day-to-day operations. Especially in the Golan Heights region where there was an intention to have no turbines at all since the area is extremely sensitive. Nevertheless, we made efforts to bring about a situation where it would be possible to promote the projects in the Golan Heights, under constraints and restrictions. Because of a complex situation there that has gotten more and more complicated in recent years. In order to minimize the effects of the turbines on the security system, as we know, technological measures need to be implemented. It is clear what is needed, but the solution has not yet been concluded. I know that they are working on it intensively, but unfortunately it has not yet been concluded. We believe that the conditions for approving the program are not yet ripe. Since it may be that after we approve the plan, we will discover that there are additional aspects that will cause the plan to change. Because after having the agreement, there will be an outline with the Ministry of Energy, to discuss the details of the plan and the agreements. An agreement will be drawn up. It may also affect the program, we don't know for sure how it will shape up in the end. And now, if we approve a plan right now, we create a presentation in front of the public of a plan with reliance on entrepreneurs who have something in hand. They can start running with it. A public that understands that this is what is going to happen. It is in a state where there can still be substantial changes. That is why we oppose the approval of the plan at this time, we stand by this opposition because it is not for nothing. After we confirm our outline, it will be at least 4 years before things come and you will wait for permits. It's a lot of time. I'm not sure we're - towards realization. I mean, sit here plan 3 they want to approve today a plan that will wait so long. Now I go to the second side of my reference, which refers to the program on a concrete level. I put the principle aspect aside for a moment. The plan at the end can be a moment I will add first - although in the end it is important to clarify in the previous context that the height turbines whose exact location can change. It may happen after the outline is formulated and we understand what we have in hand. In this context, it is important for me to clarify that even at the permit stage we will oppose permits. Until the solutions that will be defined in order to minimize, not cancel but minimize the consequences on the security system, are realized. Now in relation to this plan we have carried out a process of examining the locations of the turbines. The locations themselves at this stage in the existing situation picture, we issued a document that defines what can be progressed with and what cannot be progressed with. And in relation to the IDF camps, posted camps, I am not referring to this as a camp, okay? Any place where the security system can station soldiers is called a camp for us. These camps are We have camps that are less than 500 meters from turbines tens of meters Hundreds of meters. There are other camps within 500 meters. Now, they are manned from time to time. Some times are longer, some are less This will move forward, it is important to understand that we see these camps as change camps that definitely have the potential to also reach a permanent staffing situation. Therefore, in the current situation, we request that a representative of the Minister of Defense be included in the operating team and the team will also have authority regarding health aspects and it should be emphasized that this is valid in relation to the camps IDF. Because the discussion of the soldiers who are in the camp is lawful for any citizen living in the settlement. Again Mahana stated that they live here relatively regularly for long periods of time. In addition to this, it is important to say that we made it clear to the entrepreneur as part of the commitment letter that he would have to sign that there would also be certain security circumstances that he would have to stop the turbines and that he would receive a directive. Again, I'm talking about security circumstances. which will require him to stop the turbines for the period of time that will be defined, the specific turbines that will be defined. And he takes it upon himself, he said in the discussion that took place with us, he takes upon himself the responsibility. In addition, we made it clear to him that he understands that whenever the IDF decides to staff these outposts and these camps on a permanent basis, there is such a possibility that the situation there changes from morning to morning. So he understands that there may be an outpost that we will man it permanently and he assumes the risk of the turbine if he is unable to provide a solution that satisfies the health, environmental protection, etc. factors, he may have to reach a state of interrupted interruption of the turbine and it simply does not Act as long as soldiers are in range which is a range that creates a problem. The entrepreneur said that he understands this, that he takes responsibility. We are assuming that these things happen, it is a mechanism that is a reasonable mechanism in our opinion. That's it, I really think we have to wait with it. We are running forward with too many plans, we will eventually reach a situation where there will be a pile of plans that will wait 3 to 4 years until they can be realized, it is not certain that this is what the state wants.__ Our understanding was formed in the process itself. And actually when we realized that these camps were not taken into account in the review, and may be again, this is also input that we receive. It is possible that these camps will be staffed later. Here the question arose, what do we do if now soldiers live in a camp that is 90 meters 100 meters from a turbine, what does this mean? We are the mechanism that actually says that in relation to a normal normal situation, where soldiers can live in the camp, there is a team, an operating team, that will also deal with health aspects in accordance with the policies of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environmental Protection, a representative of the Ministry of Defense will be there. Now we will discuss these issues. If the camp is now manned and there is now a need to change the operating regime of the turbine, change the limit on the turbine, protect it acoustically, I don't know what other things are possible. But I guess all options are open. This is actually the mechanism that will give us the answer to the soldiers who may be sent to the camp. OK? Now regarding your first question, look at the end I was told here that every problem can be solved with engineering, it's a matter of money",0,0,0,0,0,Weakly opposed,0,"The statement reflects concerns about the potential impacts of a wind turbine project, particularly in relation to military camps that might be established near the turbines. The speaker discusses the need for flexibility in the project's operation to accommodate changes, such as the permanent staffing of nearby military outposts, which could necessitate modifications to the turbine's operation to address health and environmental concerns. The mention of needing to potentially interrupt the turbine's operation and the acknowledgment of not having considered these military camps in the initial review suggest a cautious approach to the project's implementation. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of a mechanism to address these issues as they arise, indicating a focus on managing potential negative impacts rather than outright opposition or support for the project. The overall tone is one of caution and preparedness to adapt, rather than a clear stance for or against the project.

It is not to make a decision on the announcement of the plan in this area. This perception of ours is not specific but from an overall view. You ... hear me here ... standing and when the turbines were presented in the Golan Heights you did not hear me say these words. This thing comes from an overall view of the knowledge and analyzes of where yes and where not and the sensitivities as done by the inter-ministerial team of the planning director, by the National Planning and Building Council which saw things in an overall view. And specifically in this area during the discussion for the approval of the TMA, which was a double discussion both for the approval of the TMA and for the approval of the recommendations of the inter-ministerial team, this website was not there. A council member submitted a counter proposal, in any case from this overall evidence we do not recommend this area, this area, once again I want to zoom in on the complex that is currently being proposed. And if I look south, they used to say the Afula Beit Shean road, but now to be honest I'll say, let's look at the Emek train and look north, in any case when you look from this area to the north you see Ramat Ya'im, you see Nahal Issachar, you see Nahal Tavor Sirin. It's all one unit to which, Shiron said it's the most central open area in northern Israel, that's the unit. And so that you will not be surprised that a turbine will arrive here in Issachar, we will also oppose there because we oppose this entire complex for the reasons stated. And we expect the hotel to also address these things in a comprehensive way and not just that. Now, one more word on the comprehensive aspect and now I will be careful with my words. But I will just say that Rami is a senior partner in a parallel work that is being done by the Planning Administration, in general to examine all the treatment of the issue of the turbines. We are talking There are things like establishing rules, science to determine the degree of damage to the turbines. They are talking about matters such as an operating regime, if they have to stop the turbines from operating. If necessary, they will tell you in the information and those who are not, I am not sure that everyone is. But we expect that the move of the Hotal, even though it is a committee that can limit everything, on TMA 35 and TMA 1 and on the processes in the planning administration and on the whole world except the army, sorry Ram. We expect this testimony to be a reference... and this This is also a reason at this time not to promote the second plan, in any case what I am saying is that most of the area proposed here on the blue line here is not relevant at all to the matter of turbines and it would be nice to exclude it, all the areas of the ridges, all the areas of the forests which are state lands, which KKL-Junk has a contract on the area. How can an entrepreneur go now and do on these areas. Now two more words about the winged thing in all this. The mandate is legal as you and others know. In this matter, it is from the Nature and Parks Authority by virtue of the laws we trust. And I say the things in the most careful and knowledge-based way possible. According to most of the information we have today, this is an area that we consider to be red, it is recommended not to erect wind turbines in it for reasons Shiron and Dan, who will probably elaborate more, according to the best of our knowledge, this is inevitably similar to whoever is promoting the matter here, has put his money on the deer fund, as the CEO said ""For the previous authority, the previous as far as we are concerned.

There are turbine farms near here, there are already proven vulnerabilities and we will expand the monitoring of our money by our people and later bring more data. But the data available today for the nearby turbine farm has a vulnerability. Whoever comes and says that there are wind turbines in this area and does not harm at all, is nothing more than a demagogue. Today there is data, so-called real data.

I was told by a senior statistician from the Hebrew University that most of us studied with us, give me your data and tell me what you want to get and you will get it and that's what you heard here unfortunately. So just very briefly there is an existing farm in the survey that was done where only day migrants were counted only 34,000 birds however in Tel 76 the turbines are much higher, there the turbines we are talking about Sirin's alpacas are only 73 meters but the damage found in them is the dimensions of the turbines of sub For 76 compared to Afcon, this is a model that estimated how much damage there would be and soon you will see what actually happened in the medium turbines of 73 meters compared to what was estimated here. By the way, one of the better surveys that have ever been done in Israel was done here. Those who presented, if nothing more, it's the two... of the birds who do a lot of work for the environmental bodies here in Israel, but their results probably wouldn't look good enough, so they had to recruit someone to present data that is acceptable to CRN a little differently. The damage is calculated only on the migrants per day was almost 9 birds, the damage according to our model that was done in the first edition was 91 birds, then they played with it, it went down to 49 and this is fundamentally wrong, they did it according to a farm width of 1 kilometer, but they write in the document that it is 4 kilometers wide, they should have To double it, there is a mistake here that they did not notice in underestimating that in practice the minimal damage to the values ​​we took all their values ​​we did not play even though we have one criticism or another, but as a survey this is the best survey that has been done in Israel also on the subject of bats, and to their credit and to the promoter's credit it's just a shame who then tried to dwarf the Deviram.

You can explain why later, whoever wants to, it's just a waste of time and - 34 bats a company in the United States found in 2020 the damage to agriculture Damage from wind turbines and another disease in bats will reach $3.7 billion, these bats are insectivores, thanks to them there are orchards there, thanks to them there are vineyards there. The main damage to the turbines in Ramat Sirin is above the vineyards, and it is a species some of which are in danger of extinction and this is what a stork looks like when it passed through the main turbine Separately, the body separately, it's like Sirin level. The professor presented you here with some kind of calculation, sorry, he took a model and distorted it, or you use the model as it is without assumptions, on the contrary, the model says that you arrive at an angle, the chance of injury is greater and he also says that it is an underestimation, this is the same model that he relies on, the same model only, a Scottish model, a model ... a friend he writes .... Not only that, the argument that they fly perpendicular to the wind, sorry, there is no such situation, birds do not fly perpendicular to the wind, they correct themselves, we can show you a full lesson on migration, we have transmitters every second that measure the behavior of a bird like this We measure the migration of the birds and the danger of extinction in Israel precisely at an angle to the wind of almost 90 degrees, at 80 degrees and at 100 degrees and not a single bird is in one position at a given moment, they change all the time and the impact is the highest.

The philosophy that spoke at the time in TMA that wind turbines could be erected on the edge of a landscape complex, she was really talking about margins, she didn't give anything quantitative, or numerical, or what is called a margin fence, but there is someone who is intelligent and has common sense who comes and sees that in this case these are No, it's not the margin in the quantitative sense and in the qualitative sense it's pretty much sitting there in the center, I had a hard time really convincing myself that it meets this idea of ​​TAMA 35 with its margin, so there's some difficulty in seeing it in the geographical spatial context. From the other aspect of the birds, I'm just asking for a minute. Dr. Anna Trachtenbort, from the Ecology and Open Spaces Division, is here, and she also addressed this issue. She wants to say something about this aspect briefly. It's not a secret that the whole issue of renewable energies in general creates an internal value dilemma. Everyone wants the This. Our office comes and promotes it and not to mention committed to a government decision and so on, and so on, the Paris agreements and so on, but on the other hand, one lobe of the brain, the other lobe comes and says yes renewable energies but not at all costs and in all places, we don't , as Shratz spoke at the beginning, we have not objected to this day almost except for very minor corrections, Zeev and I have a history on this but in general we are in favor of this matter but not at any price and not everywhere, the price here is problematic in this location, and I talked about The spatial interest of the margin. The office's position is very clear, the office's position is clear and I defined it in the wrong place and at any cost and there is a certain difficulty here.   Just a word on a personal level, I've been in Tel Aviv for five years, I don't remember such a situation of wall-to-wall opposition to each of his arguments, and I put aside the methodology and the statistics, and I really, the entrepreneur and I were on field trips when we started to study the issue of turbines, we went out there to the field And this is something very, very very this time, very unusual, and what will remain here after the opposition and after the results, is an emphasis that this important thing called a scenic complex, I will again put the birds aside and this is very important, but the scenic complex. We heard here today about TAMA 35 It's our land that is getting filled up, and the puzzle is getting filled up, there are no more empty pieces like this on the floor, and we have preserved a really special piece of land, really special, an area that should remain that way, a border without a border is an area without a border",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker expresses concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly emphasizing the unsuitability of the location and the potential negative impacts on the landscape and local environment. They mention a ""wall-to-wall opposition"" to the project and highlight the importance of preserving the scenic and ecological value of the area. Despite acknowledging the general support for renewable energy and the commitments under the Paris agreements, the speaker stresses that renewable energy should not be pursued ""at all costs and in all places,"" indicating significant reservations about this specific project due to its location and broader impacts.

I do not pretend to express a professional opinion regarding the question of what is problematic or what concession is required by the Air Force or the defense system in order to approve the plan in full or even in part in full, but there are 2 things here that are important to emphasize even if There was a successful dialogue with the Air Force a few years ago, and the process really moved towards certain issues, the dialogue that should have been fully matured for this discussion did not exactly take place for an understandable reason, so it is for a reason that stalled the process a bit, it is the same issue of the technological solution that the Air Force, that the defense system requires it not only in relation to this project but in relation to wind projects in general. This matter, as far as we understand, is on the verge of closure in the triangle at the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Energy, and the Ministry of Defense, and he will solve the problem. The license 5 years ago and a large part of the inability to advance was due to the same technological problem that stopped the attempts to reach more successful solutions than there are currently. What seems to me to be the right thing right now is to confirm what can be confirmed at this meeting here which is not yet final and allow us, with emphasis on me, to conduct an intensive dialogue with the security establishment in the next two months out of some kind of openness and I assume that there are flexibilities that have not been exhausted until now. I can't prove them because we haven't started them yet, but I can assume them from the little experience I have in similar projects, and if we move forward with them, it might be possible to reach a critical mass from the point of view of the developer on the one hand, and things that the Air Force or the Army can live with on the other hand and will not require any which is from a conflict... I say this also from a broad perspective, overall, as far as I understand, much larger projects of wind stations, wind turbines in the Golan Heights have been approved, as far as I understand these things and I guess I understand a little The sensitivity of the Golan Heights to some things is immeasurably great, and the need for intensity in various situations there for the movement of aircraft at low altitudes is very, very high and despite everything they found some kind of solution out of a balance between needs that are naturally opposed but between need A and need B they find the Compromises, and if it is found in the Golan Heights on a very large scale in an area that in my view is very sensitive, I assume that it will be possible to arrive at a better answer in this area as well than the answer that has been received so far in the security establishment, even though I have no objections to it, she is a faithful professional representative of",0,0,0,0,0,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project.

Once again, since partial data was presented here by the entrepreneurs, only partial data that I do not at all agree with both the way it was presented and the way it was analyzed, and these are things that came up in the last week, we submitted 14 pages of detailed documents, with dozens of sections on why we don't accept these new analyses. I will briefly present to you the data that appears in the survey of the entrepreneurs themselves and on the basis of which we submitted the opinion, and if there is time I will refer to the new presentations. In short, I will once again say that my opinion opposing the plan remains the same even after the discussions and the various documents that were submitted to us last week and we addressed them in writing, and if there is time I will address them here. My opinion is divided into three main parts, the first part refers to the quantitative part, the amount of birds that may be harmed due to the establishment of the farm, and this is what a fan was talking about at the moment, we will touch on this as well, the second part qualitatively refers to sensitive populations that may be harmed due to the establishment of the farm and to its quality of the habitat, and it's not just vineyards as presented here by Rami, it's an atrogenic area, I'll touch on it soon. The third part unites and summarizes the first two parts. Once again, contrary to what was presented here, it's as if the hotel wanted to delve deeper and all that and that's why it was Various surveys, no, it wasn't like that, the process was as follows. In 6/2019, a bird survey was submitted to LoTL by the entrepreneurs who hired the Hovra ecological consulting company, two birders who submitted a survey for us after the completions were extremely short. The entrepreneurs themselves estimated in this survey that they would harm only during the migration seasons 91 birds per turbine is almost 2000 birds Only during the migration period in the whole farm, without local poultry and without any other certain assumptions that are even more valuable. We found that this survey was carried out in a good way and by the way it corresponds to the current estimates of RTG, after that when they submitted the survey and the entrepreneurs realized that we had criticism and some kind of objection and The opinion will probably be negative, they asked to wait with the publication of the opinion and asked to make renewed corrections and the hotel of course granted the request and on 7/2019 the promoters together with the same original consulting company submitted the second survey and there they actually reduced the damage estimates by half you can see 49 Birds per turbine 1000 per farm once again estimates are missing.",0,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the impact of a wind turbine project on avian populations, questioning the adequacy of the environmental assessments provided by the developers. They highlight discrepancies in bird harm estimates and criticize the process by which these estimates were revised. The speaker also indicates a lack of satisfaction with the responses to their objections, suggesting that the developers' adjustments were reactive rather than proactive. Overall, the speaker's focus on demanding more accurate assessments, their skepticism about the developers' commitment to addressing environmental impacts, and their insistence on discussing these issues in detail indicate opposition to the project.

A second point that I missed was indeed mentioned, but not emphasized in the analysis presented here, this is the same issue of sensitive species of nestlings, of sensitive species including species that Israel is obligated to protect also within the framework of treaties to which it is a signatory including the Convention on Migratory Species, including the agreement regarding specific species of raptors. If we are talking about treaties to which Israel is a signatory, I will also mention the issue of bats. It was mentioned here that the activity of 12 endangered species has been observed in Israel, most of those species, Israel is obligated to protect them also within the framework of the Yurowitz Agreement, and we also know about bats and about the existing farm in Sirin that there are vulnerabilities Canceled, a fan presented it earlier and I'll finish here",0,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses concerns about the impact of the wind turbine project on avian and bat populations, specifically questioning the adequacy of the surveys and analyses presented by the developer.

A lot has been said, there is not much to add, we are talking here about an order of magnitude of between 4 times an order of magnitude beyond the values ​​that the National Council has put its hands on, 25 compared to 14, these values ​​according to TMA 41, that is to say, such a thing cannot be talked about, if We would be talking about 20 compared to 14. We are talking here almost an order of magnitude beyond that, if we take the presentation of RTG about the mistakes they made in the second report they submitted. I have to say that the developer behaves in a way that I really haven't seen many such cases, not really No, he submits a survey with wings, receives an uncomfortable answer This morning, referring to RTG's analysis of the vulnerability in Afcon's opinion, this is behavior that I really have not seen such things, and it is behavior that is not willing to see his plan rejected and he is doing everything he can to prevent it from being rejected even though everything points against this plan. There's a way to do things and there's a way to do things it was insanely blatant. I move on to the other things. First of all, I say the topic of birds is an important topic because I really think 50 birds if we take this value is the only thing that can be accepted in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality we need to pay attention.

There is no doubt that this thing does not comply with the instructions of TMA 35. As for the scenic complex, there is nothing to turn it around. I will only complete. There are really several points here that are not the main thing, but everything comes together. One of the issues of the land is not at the heart of it, it is not within the authority of the committee, but it should be taken into account that the land issue here is completely unresolved, it should also be taken into account, the committee is definitely a consideration They drop a plan on this, fine, but it's something else.

The draft that was presented to the esteemed forum is a draft that was not adopted and the policy document was not approved. The committee's country document does not speak at all about recommended complexes, it speaks about areas that are not recommended, and therefore every area of ​​Ramat Sirin is not an area that is recommended for wind turbines, that's one thing.

I can also point out that to date no plan has been deposited or approved or decided to deposit a plan whose damage values ​​are so high even after the corrections made The developer in the review, so in our opinion the program is also a program that they did not want to advance. In addition, I will point out what they did not mention, it is possible that the Ministry of Defense will expand on it, I have in my hands a document from 6/9, from the Ministry of Defense that actually disqualifies 14 Toribans out of 20, so the disqualification is Not a disqualification due to technological means, the disqualification is for the area of ​​operations issue, we will leave it to the Ministry of Defense to do fine",0,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The statement by Mr. Dror Chai from the North District Planning Office indicates opposition to the wind turbine project.

This project is truly one of the only sites outside of the Golan Heights that are suitable for wind projects and as such was also recommended by the district committee, it is not exceptional in terms of its negative effects from any of the approved projects in the region, including in Ramat Issachar from a number of projects right on the same measurement axis that were approved. In the end, we understand that there is no project, including a renewable energy project, that does not have an impact or change on the environment, but we are sure that the total benefits to the environment or to human life are much higher. My daughter just told me about a study in 2050, it is about the Earth warming by at least 20 degrees, the State of Israel by 2030 will switch entirely, entirely to electric cars, and the meaning is that we will need a lot of electricity here, and a lot of green electricity that will not continue to pollute and create additional problems . I think it is really illogical in a situation like this to oppose a project that is so environmental, and so green, we commit ourselves as we committed to each of the bodies sitting here to try and minimize the negative effects by working together. I am really a person who loves the environment between bird law, an officer in the army, I understand all the considerations here and I certainly understand them to the end, but I think that those who love the environment must not oppose such a period and looking at the macro where we need to go, we must not oppose such a project which is environmental, and I'm sure that in a few years we will all be very proud of this project that it will be a joint work and the disturbances will be really, really minimal and I really appeal and ask everyone, everyone who loves the environment or a citizen to support this project because it is a very important project, and very central to the goals of the State of Israel . As I said, being an entrepreneur in Israel today is very not easy. Where you don't throw a stone, there are a thousand and one problems. I think this is not a good enough reason not to promote and do projects, and surely such a project is positive.

23/09/2019,תתל 76,"ות""ל",Developers,"I will briefly describe to you the work that was done, there is a larger document that we forwarded which contains greater detail, naturally I will try to be brief and not bore you. We were asked to check whether the damage line found in the survey, in the risk analysis carried out as part of the survey, is established and can be trusted. Since the bird survey was done in an exceptional way and the report was very good and the radar survey we received the data of millions of signals only towards the end of the process and we decided not to try to change it, we do not obtain information on the numbers of birds at risk from the moment they were entered into the survey and we actually checked whether the risk Determined based on this survey is really the right risk. The thing that was discovered The first thing that was discovered in reading the survey and analyzing the survey was that in the risk assessment no attempt was made to check where the birds fly and from where they fly and since the birds fly in different directions not necessarily into turbines we checked the issue of flight directions. What you see in front of you is a summary of both the bird surveys and the radar survey. They say what is expected in advance. The birds migrate south, and these are the two main directions in which the birds migrate south and return back north. There are fewer birds, so the arrows are smaller, but these are the two directions in which On the other hand, the direction of the wind is not at all discussed in the test, in the construction of the summary estimate, the direction of the wind Sirin was given for testing in the balls. Wind in this area, we also checked it in comparison with other wind directions, in Tel Hana, Bibinal, in Neve Yaer, etc., the wind direction is from the west while, as you have seen, most of the birds' movement is either north or south. For visualization, I inserted a hand-drawn picture of turbines, turbines are standing perpendicular to the direction of the wind so you can see that the faces of the turbines will be, the typical will be in this direction that they are standing in this direction while the birds will soon see the next slide as you can see we just projected the wind directions onto the bird directions, as you can see the birds fly north to south, or south to the north, while the turbines are standing with their faces perpendicular to the north, and therefore parallel to the north, so the chance that most of the birds will run into a turbine or pass by a turbine or turn towards a turbine is relatively small, in the original report all the birds that passed, all the 950 thousand birds I will soon add to this number stood as if All of them fly in a collective suicide attempt into turbines. In practice, what actually happens in the field, the turbines will stand as you see and most of the birds will fly as the blue arrows show between the turbines. The turbines are at great distances from each other, the turbine itself is 180 meters, and the turbine creates a ripple that creates that conflicts the air directions, therefore one turbine must be separated from the other by about half a kilometer so that the wind that comes out of one turbine does not affect the activity of the other turbine, between these half a kilometer between turbines There is enough space for the birds to pass and the great majority of the birds will fly between these turbines in the direction between the north and the south that the turbines are facing and it is unlikely that they will not be fully aware of the fact that they are flying between the turbines and that is why we took the number of birds the original bird estimate was lowered, the bird estimate from 1.2 million birds to 925 thousand birds in the original report since the turbine the question was asked what is the wind speed in the area, 30% of the time the turbines will not be able to move because the wind is less than 3 meters per second, therefore the birds that pass during the period when there are no turbines for example will certainly not be harmed by the turbines, the 925 thousand birds are as if at risk of being harmed by turbines, but if we add to the direction of movement, the south, southeast, southwest, east west, etc. We find here that around 95 thousand birds are at risk, and after we take into account the probability of a bird flying in the direction of a turbine, the type of birds, the total number of birds on the route at risk, the total number of birds that will actually enter a turbine, even birds that fly towards a turbine, there are several more turbines in front of them Between which there are those famous 500 meters. Even those that will fly between turbines and then also a bird that enters into the blades of a turbine as strange as it sounds you will not necessarily encounter, the turbine rotates at a speed of approximately 8 revolutions per minute, the blade every point, approximately every 3 seconds, a bird of 15 kilometers per second travels this distance in a second, So the estimate is that only about 10% of the birds will be harmed, we took a higher estimate, we eventually arrive after all the calculations at an estimate of about 9 birds out of the turbine per year will be killed as a result of this passage of birds. I will only add in a framed article that among other things you can see in the middle of the list of directions, you can see wandering birds. The radar cannot diagnose this, but the ornithologists did diagnose that there are local birds that wander in the area, and birds that wander in the area and move around are at a much higher risk because By nature, they may sometimes fly south and sometimes fly towards Turbina. We calculated this and estimated that about 4 of them would be killed in Turbina, a total estimate of about 9 birds per year per turbine. We also checked this according to the size of birds, since the original report cited large, medium-sized birds , and small and we relied on the same classification from the authors of the bird report and according to this classification we arrive at the same number of 9 birds but as you can see 6 small birds, 24 large birds, .. the numbers are different, a larger bird is much more likely, its chance of being hurt is Much bigger than a small bird. I just want to show that this is the last slide of this series, in the big document we brought many other examples, but this is an example from a turbine field, a turbine field by the sea, in Denmark, and what you see on the left side is a Tor field",0,0,0,1,0,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They provide detailed calculations and assessments to argue that the actual impact on birds is minimal, emphasizing that only a small number of birds are likely to be harmed by the turbines each year. The speaker also mentions compliance with existing studies and classifications, and uses examples from other turbine fields to support their argument. The detailed analysis and reliance on data to minimize perceived negative impacts suggest a supportive stance towards the project.

First of all, I will bring something that I would like to bring up. I think that the Rimon company is an excellent company that has done a lot for agriculture in our area, and I think that they are really people whose projects they did with us, I take my hat off to them, they helped us a lot and they are one of the main reasons that this area is so fertile And we are fighting for it so much now. Why are we fighting for him now? Because our biggest concern is about many things that, contrary to the surprising stories that I have seen at the moment, there are many things that have not yet been tested that are related to agriculture. I will focus on Ze'ev's request from earlier. I will not just dwell on things said by my predecessors, both Nitzan and Perry. I will add a few things that are very important to me that this audience will hear them as well as the Rimon company and I also tried my best to ask them to move this place from this fertile area to another place and they will be able to testify to it firsthand of course they are doing what they have to do, but I I ask once again also in this forum not to do this project in the current location which is in the heart of an agricultural area, why? For the reasons they said and in the end they are seriously harmed in the issue of a regime of spraying from the air and from the floor that interferes with the operation of the pest prevention section and departments, is it a national prevention of the lack of spraying from the air that the state is doing, and if God forbid we are attacked by a locust, it won't happen lately that they will take action on the entire area, It is possible to do, a firefighting story, if a fire breaks out, certainly to the west of the turbines and between them, this fire could start both on the moshav houses in an easterly wind and on the plantations in a westerly wind and cause tremendous damage. You cannot get close to these turbines. The other essential thing, in my opinion, in this matter of the turbines, in addition to the other things that people here have said, there is no doubt that all the pollination activity of the bees in this very combination that the HaTaz just talked about of an open area with this, in almonds for example without the pollination activity there are no almonds, no livelihood and hundreds of people live from it This one to this day.",1,0,0,1,0,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses significant concerns about the potential negative impacts of the wind turbine project on local agriculture and pest control practices. They mention untested effects on agriculture, interference with pest prevention due to restricted aerial spraying, and risks to pollination activities essential for crops like almonds. The speaker also highlights the potential danger of fires exacerbated by the turbines' presence, which could harm both residential and agricultural areas. Despite acknowledging the positive contributions of the Rimon company to local agriculture, the speaker clearly opposes the project due to its perceived threats to agricultural practices and local livelihoods.

We found a difference in the activity of the bats, a difference that is in keeping with the seasons and in keeping with the nesting sites, there are 2 nesting sites that have a lot of activity so they were fall and spring, we found a lot of activity as well. If you can move to the next slide, but one of the interesting findings, we are looking for another thing that we were asked according to the outline to check the connection to water sources, a connection is a close connection between bats and water sources for several reasons they come there to drink and it is water sources that attract insects, we deal with water sources that attract Insects So insects come to this site and bats feed on them so they are attracted to this site. What you see here is a graph that represents the activity of the bats in the summer. We did something similar in the winter, we were not asked to do it in the winter, but we did something similar in the winter, and we also see vigorous activity in the winter, even though there are more hopes for bats, nevertheless they are attracted to the remaining water source, we checked Nahal Tamar, we checked three reservoirs. You can see in the graph of the columns that there is a lot of activity in the reservoirs in relation to all the sites, you see the low columns, the red ones represent the activity in all the sites, including those that have a rush of activity and this is in the summer, so the difference is definitely significant so this is a very, very important detail, the same connection To sister habitats, to water sources, this is not an unusual scientific finding. We know this from around the world, certainly from studies in Israel that there is such a close connection between bats and water sources, so in the map of the RTG this is what we were asked to find. We checked, we tried to locate shelter sites And as I said, we didn't find any, and we did a pretty thorough search, and then what I thought was appropriate to do was to place detectors near settlements, and we placed them in several places and near the bee simulations, as you can see in the slide, a lot of activity was found, of course the report goes into great detail about this particular survey, but There is a lot of activity of the genus and I say genus and not species because there are several species. But it is difficult to know for sure which species one way or another is an endangered species and what should be said here regarding this particular find. There was very intense activity in the fall, probably gathering for mating",0,0,0,1,0,Support,1,"The statement provided discusses detailed findings from environmental impact assessments related to a wind turbine project, specifically focusing on the effects on bat populations and their connection to water sources. The speaker outlines the comprehensive studies conducted, which were not only aligned with regulatory requirements but also extended beyond them (e.g., conducting studies in the winter season even when not mandated). The detailed reporting and adherence to guidelines suggest a proactive approach to understanding and mitigating environmental impacts. The speaker also mentions placing detectors near settlements to monitor activity, indicating an effort to minimize impacts on local wildlife and address potential concerns.

Overall, the statement reflects a supportive stance towards the project, as it emphasizes the thoroughness of the studies conducted, compliance with environmental guidelines, and proactive measures taken to address and monitor impacts on local wildlife.

We, unlike the developer, do not have deep pockets, the so-called battery of consultants and certainly not a backlog like ... two weeks before the discussion and that's fine, their right is an achievement and that's fine. I am in a minor budget that we approved in the plenary session of the council, we have to make do with what we have and bring our truth. Before we can talk here, we are also a member of the seat of Deborah who owns estates, estate owners because at the business level, so to speak, they are the ones who are supposed to enjoy the dividend of the project, that is, it is not the residents of the extension, also a member of the agricultural committee, the council's engineering department, and we are actually here We will talk about some basic points. One is the main area of ​​the Sirin Plateau, in the north of the Golan Heights the wind regime is completely different, while in the heart of the State of Israel, in the heart of the Galilee. One of the unique field cells that exists today in the north of Ramat Sirin and Ramat Menashe, Ramat Menashe was saved by the Red Buzzard who knows, I'm talking about the field cell and also things that they tried to do there recently and also the subject of the district committee I believe his position on the matter will come up later. The whole matter of uncertainty of this plan, although there are recommendations, or ideas and all kinds of points, but the plan itself has never pointed out exactly a point that it requires for the turbine, where it will be inside the polygon, what is its height, even 210 nobody really knows, By the way, the maximum size in question is 190,200, numbers here from the developer's side is 180,210 meters. We are talking here about 2/3 of Mount Tabor, 2/3 of the height of the upper Mount Tabor observed in the field and this is no small matter, 200 is nothing. The uncertainty, the lack of experience of the entrepreneur, you yourself came the first time he came here, it is true he is engaged in agriculture but he did not deal in turbines, such a thing was not in the field yet with us. The issue of the winged animals is a very central issue in this event, I leave it to the members of the RTG, it is part of what characterizes this unique field cell. A new nature reserve that was announced two months ago Sirin Canals, whether you have heard or not, a new nature reserve right next to the field cell in question Precision agriculture is an area of ​​which more than 3/4 of this polygon is planted. The developer is the one who took a positive part in the establishment of this project, but the developer at that moment also wants to maximize the area from an economic point of view, and that's fine, it's a business and it's his right, we'll talk about that as well. Another very important issue is the relationship to the land, an agreement between Shadomat Deborah and the developer Whole, this is an event in itself and wise men will discuss it in this matter. In the end, the community, the people, settled this area, people who came to live in this place to settle this land, held these lands for a reason, Kfar Kama With its unique Circassian population, Kfar Tabor, residents of the Lower Galilee, Yavniel, all of whom are opposed to this event, including the heads of the councils, and including Moshav Shademt Deborah, who by the way was not even invited to the event here, did not receive an irrelevant summons, he is not even part of the program that he is supposed to be to be a partner in some corporation with 26% and correct me if I'm wrong, so we'll talk about these things now and I'll let the people talk",1,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses several concerns and criticisms regarding the wind turbine project.

23/09/2019,תתל 76,"ות""ל",Government,"I will say three things, one of the presentations presented here according to which apparently two weeks ago we referred for the first time is 11/16 to a similar request for tall turbines in the same place, and the developer already knew then, their place, we referred in 2016 that turbines above 45 meters point cannot be erected there. This is the situation not two weeks ago and no shoes and it infuriates me because it creates a feeling as if we react here regularly and there is a long staff work that has been done here and we have considered it time and time again, and it is really infuriating first of all. Second thing, as I repeat myself like a broken record, the last time I played on a turntable from 1948, but without a technological solution, they won't be able to build turbines and we continue to play, I think, programs that have been sitting on the shelf for three or four years until the moment when it might be possible to start building them. One last thing, in this specific program we are in a different situation, that is not the point here, we are in a situation where there are 14 turbines out of 20 that they simply will not be able to build, not because of a technological problem, because of flight safety near them, and this matter was passed on to the developer, we told him that we do not see any logic in promoting such a program because And the only thing that can possibly be promoted is that there may be turbines that are also in big stomach pains, we approved them. Therefore, we will exert all our weight so that not one of the 14 turbines that we opposed will be built, neither with a technological solution nor without a technological solution. By the way, there is a... squadron commander... who landed the plane into the bushes to get the wounded out, broke half of the helicopter and got them out of there. Well first of all I think this program is really a red line. I will say why it is a red line, first of all there are normal aspects that are talked about, which are the technological aspect that I repeat again and again and say, we are in other plans, even let's talk about it, plans are put into the planning that we know, that we know that it will be no less than 3 to 4 years until they can issue them permits or To build them means putting outdated plans on the table that can be discussed in another year, two years and nothing will happen, nothing will happen. In this context, I will say what is called the recording and the protocol, and I am sorry to repeat myself again, please be patient that the construction of tall wind turbines involves many limitations and constraints in light of the situation in the north, in the northern region. In order to minimize the consequences for the security activity, it is necessary to implement technological measures and this has not yet been agreed upon between the relevant ministries. Therefore, we believe that the conditions for promoting the program are not yet ripe and it is not appropriate to promote it at this stage, before you summarize all the relevant aspects because the details can still change, and the location of The turbines, etc., and there is public reliance here, and therefore we are opposed to promoting a plan at this time and we need to talk about it after the summary of the outline. This is if they decide to promote a plan, again I qualify it in places where we have no substantial objection but only because of technological solutions. If we decide to promote it, then we make it clear that the details can change, the height can change, the location can change, and we will oppose everything else from any plan until the solution is agreed upon The technological one, I'll just put it there for a second because we did a lot of rounds on it. Now I go to the essential aspect, the developer has known for three years, for three years he knows that he cannot erect turbines over 45 meters there because of a flight safety issue, now what is flight safety? At the end of an inspection throughout the country, we fly at a very, very low altitude, in certain areas under certain conditions, and we constantly weigh the public and national interest against the risk to human life and aircraft, and in places where we understand that it is possible to allow with little risk or to change something. 98 Together with the developer, we are examining the possibility of obtaining an administrative path that allows it to be done in a way that is not very complicated without transferring restrictions from one side to the other and harming someone else's planning without a safety risk, we are doing this, in places where, like in Kasra, we could allow tall turbines in areas on the outskirts of settlements that also That's how you fly up there, we confirmed it, in the Golan Heights, despite the super complex aspects that we have there, we confirmed it. that I, I don't want to say for the first time, I don't want to exaggerate, but I don't remember a case where we are in a situation where a plan is so blatantly a plan that it creates a significant risk to flight safety that the authority authorized by the Air Force along its entire avenue of management and command up to the highest levels says here It is impossible to build turbines and the developer knows this, he has known this for three years and despite this he comes here and presents a plan for the deposit, this is really a red line, this is something that is forbidden, he is not allowed to cross because it makes this thing a waste. In this context, I also stand. We will stand on our back legs. It will not happen. We have lost enough pilots here in Israel because someone got inside an antenna and... it will not happen, we will not reach a situation where pilots fly and, God forbid, get inside a turbine. 6 The goddess with big stomach pains, that name is also not trivial, it is also a reason to understand that if there with great difficulty we tried to understand then 14 I offered, I told him, I told him they were with us, we issued an opinion because in the middle of August we realized that it was for a deposit, we took the data, we checked it again, we issued it while Two weeks really at a crazy pace we sent them a reference back, which says 14 no, 6 we are ready to go with you he asked for a meeting last week we told him, we said honestly listen if you want to go and split the plan submit 6, we will talk to you as much as you want we will try to think of solutions we never We didn't say no to those who wanted to sit with us, never happened. You want to submit a remedial plan after that, but what did he do, in which he wants both, but let's deposit, what is it that we deposit, a planning institution puts its hand on the plan for deposit, the plan can be approved as it is. What are you saying, planning institution, wait, what plan, 14 turbines out of 20 will not be built because the authorized party will not approve their construction.

What I also wanted to say is that most of the birds that are disappearing today are species that fly at a relatively low altitude, and in any case, in the bottom line, we see that the number of birds that was in Basker's own models turned out to be quite ... the order of magnitude of the estimate is about 49 birds per turbine per year, which is an unusual and high number that we think is It is especially excessive that we saw that we checked the survey that was done that parameters such as the direction of the wind and the direction of the birds' flight were not taken into account and for this purpose Professor Micah Hope did a statistical analysis to come and see if this number is really worrying, if this number is indeed correct",0,0,0,1,0,Support,1,"The statement provided discusses the impact of a wind turbine project on migratory birds, referencing specific data and comparisons with other sites.

Now the species found that day are mainly medium and large species and these things about an operating regime would provide a solution, today at Icon Farm there is no operating regime, there are no birders, there is no plantation, there is no one in the field, and there are also differences of opinion because the basic assumptions made there for the purpose of evaluating the numbers - The 529 birds mentioned by Gilad are for us an owl and a flower.

23/09/2019,תתל 76,"ות""ל",Developers,"Okay, today we are presenting here a plan for the establishment of a turbine farm at Sirin Farm, we are here on behalf of the entrepreneur Carmel Yogev who is the deputy CEO of the Rimon group, Emmanuel Katan who is the manager of the entire energy session, David Sukhoi who is the CEO of Rimon Renewable Energies and in fact all the consultants that we used in the program. My presentation will actually be divided into several sub-sections, we will introduce the entrepreneur, who is a little less known here, this is the first time he comes here for a discussion in Tel Aviv, we will present the project, of course we will present the plan, the various summaries that we have done over the past few years, and then We will probably open this up for discussion. So, first of all, the Rimon company is a company whose activities are mainly environmental and agricultural, it does not actually have any commercial or real estate activities, it is from the agricultural sector, it has been working all these years for the agricultural sector, it does not take on herself any projects, she doesn't really believe in their environmental contribution, including this project, she probably wouldn't have entered into it if she didn't really believe that it has a contribution to both the environment and agriculture. This project of Rimon actually grew together with the policy that developed in Israel, in order to actually encourage the establishment of energy projects from alternative energies, in fact we received our license in 2015 and shortly after that the Israeli government actually acted to promote this issue of energy production from alternative energies including Breeze. This project stands in every way to help the State of Israel actually comply with the international treaties it is a signatory to, and I may be saying what is basically known to everyone, but nevertheless we have some feeling that in the heat of the debate that will surely arise here soon, I really want those present here not to take lightly the contributions to the project This is also on an environmental issue, on a health issue and on other issues such as social and economic. A little about the project itself, the project is actually located in the Yavniel fields, this is the Yavniel plateau, it is down here, here we are talking about Moshav Sharona, Kfar Kama, Shademut Deborah, Kfar Tabor and Kif Kish, it is actually located on the western slopes of the Sirin plateau. Also the benefits of using wind energy I think everyone is well aware of them, obviously both the Ministry of Energy and the Israeli government and the rest of the world would not promote such projects if they did not have environmental benefits. But instead of us testifying about ourselves, I think the best testimony is actually from Shuli Nezer who actually gave her opinion specifically for this plan of ours, that she herself talks about the project that is expected to reduce 98 thousand tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, I think this is the official position of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, I am convinced that the representative sitting here in front of me surely knows her and supports her. Regarding the development of energy in the world and the outlook for the future, we are actually in the entire world today, wind energy is one of the most developing fields, I will go straight here, you can see on the right the layout of the wind turbines in Europe, speaking of reliability that Nir pointed out to me, I really raise the gauntlet and I have to say that if that is the case it is covered Europe is in turmoil and there is still room, apparently. I just came back two days ago from there and saw birds, so I assume that what they learned in Europe and the experience they gained can certainly be adopted in the State of Israel. The picture on the left actually what it shows is taken from information that is actually online information that basically shows the scope of energy production from wind in Europe, you can see 11.7% of energy production in Europe was from wind. Compared to Europe, the situation, on the day, we took a random day, 9/14/19, in Israel is a very bleak situation, in fact, this technology is not able to penetrate and meet the goals that the Israeli government has set, and I very, very much hope that at the end of this day there will be some kind of positive news in this direction as well . In terms of the economic benefits of this single program, we are talking here about the production of about 150 kilowatt hours of electricity per year for 20 years, a continuous reduction in air pollution and the morbidity of residents, I think this is a very, very important thing. As we said before, 98 thousand tons Along with greenhouse gases that are saved, in fact balance and energy security in the whole issue of electricity production around the clock, 22 thousand households will actually benefit from clean electricity here. I will give some milestones that we have passed here over the years, and in fact what was in the framework of the wind policy is a bit of a summary In fact, what I have reviewed so far. 15 We actually received the license, in 2011 there was a government decision to set production quotas, in 2014, 18, we carried out, 78 which took place in 2017, here and after Then the polls were published to 77, and we actually distributed them at the end of last year, the polls and plans were reviewed here, opinions were given and today we are all gathered here to summarize the issue. I will start, I will concentrate more on the farm itself. Look, I will actually stop at TMA 10 /d/ 12, which is actually a deal on the subject of a wind farm. It was actually followed by Tzedek, a member of my office who examined various sites to erect wind turbines. This team regarding this area did not make a decision, and in fact he left it to the district committee, and then The district committee is working very, very carefully. The district committee, in fact, through Dror, who I saw sitting here, did a very, very careful job. Many of those present who represent all kinds of government ministries also sat in the discussions or their representatives in the discussions in the district committee and basically decided to approve this polygon as a polygon. which is actually suitable for plans for wind turbines. This should be taken into account because there are not very many areas in the State of Israel that are suitable for wind, and the competitiveness for them is very, very high compared to other resources, so if there is a significant polygon here that may be the next significant after the Golan Heights, it should be examined positively because There is no other place that has wind and is suitable as an area for wind turbines. We will soon present it on the maps, 1. The place we chose is accessible from national and international roads. Our polygon is large enough because it allows us to maintain a significant distance from the settlements In order to reduce as much as possible arguments with the residents. The power transmission line I will soon present it in TMAOT, but the 400 line is right next to the project",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The speaker in the statement appears to be supportive of the wind turbine project. They emphasize the benefits of the project, such as reducing greenhouse gases and providing clean electricity to 22,000 households. The speaker also highlights the careful and thorough process of obtaining licenses and approvals, including the involvement of various government ministries and the district committee's careful consideration in approving the site for the wind turbines. Additionally, the speaker mentions efforts to minimize disputes with residents by maintaining a significant distance from settlements and ensuring accessibility and infrastructure readiness.

Rami is the only owner of the land that can grant someone rights in this land, rights as a condition for obtaining an electricity license and a condition for the promotion of subtal. Yesterday, the association was informed that a plan for national infrastructure number 76 was submitted to LuTL on the area of ​​the Moshav Sha'domat square by the developer Rimon Renewable Energies Ltd. In a letter sent to the developer of the plan on 4/28/19, we requested that the developer that the plan be submitted by The association that owns the area of ​​the plan. As you know, the association owns surplus areas in the scope of 3000 dunams, a condition for the realization of the plan as well as a condition for the realization of any plan with any occupational uses is the regulation of the areas of the plot in accordance with the administrators of the Israel Lands Council. We would also add that an additional condition for the realization of an employment deal Of this type is the establishment of a joint corporation for the entrepreneur and the association, in which the association will hold at least 26% of the share capital, reminding you that no subletting of the space will be allowed. It will also be noted that even if it is possible to carry out an employment transaction subject to the conditions detailed above for the procedures and the approval of the plan in the accepted institutions, the transaction will be carried out in the scope of the area of 800 dunams only, depending on the area, division deeds to be submitted to LoTL. It goes without saying that employment transactions will be carried out in accordance with the procedures and decisions of the Council that will be valid at the time. And there is nothing in the statement.

I don't want to calculate how much money was invested, how much money is spent at this meeting on public employees who receive a salary, but it is possible at this time to do actions that are not idle actions. With all due respect, the promotion of this program is an action Idle, this entrepreneur was never allowed to submit this plan, the Electricity Authority was never allowed to issue the license, the hotel.

That is not the case. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and the majority of those sitting here are in favor of this project, I think. I'm just saying something personal if I may. From 2012 - I was on the team for the preparation of the TMA, TMA 10 /d/ 12. This is a TMA that we worked on for two years. Next month it will be 4 years since it was approved by the government and I accompanied every section. 3 years ago here on the floor below I convened what we then called a round table. December 2015. Representatives of 6-8 wind turbine entrepreneurial companies arrived here From Israel and the world. It was not a duel, it was simply one big battlefield between the entrepreneurs and RTG, an enemy.

We have reached a situation where RTG and the entrepreneur, the leading, successful and successful entrepreneur, should congratulate him for this, sitting together with the blessing of the researcher and reaching agreements. This is excellent. I want to say, this project is blessed and successful. The location if you compare it to others is certainly good. should be promoted. But let's listen to what the researcher says. This researcher has seen several programs in his life. Let's listen to the things that were here in the subcommittee. We sat here in the morning for 3 hours.   not everyone. Unfortunately, the subcommittee usually prints the decisions. It is not found. If it is printed it can be handed out and read. Add to this the spirit of the words of the environmental consultant of the Hotal, the ecological consultant. All we say is a wolf, the matter is very simple. The gestation of the plan is long anyway.

To prevent this, go to the next step. In the next step it is written, if an eagle or a wombat is injured as a result of the operation of the turbines, the developer will report to the surveillance team and the RTG within 36 hours of the date of the impact.

But, the area is very sensitive, it is very unique in terms of birds of prey, in terms of nesting, in terms of eagles nesting, in terms of migrants and in terms of eagles that have just been returned to the wild, both from Carmel and from the Three Borders area, but for some reason they also come to this area. It won't help, this issue of poultry should be treated very seriously as a value issue. This issue is valuable, it is very important. With the desire to produce electricity, which is important, we also need to create a situation that will not significantly worsen the condition of the poultry. This balance is very important, I recommend submitting the plan for government approval with the amendments I propose. The eagles are another story. These are stupid birds and there are problems with them. it's a problem. Another topic is nocturnal wanderers. Nocturnal wanderers are not appreciated either. We must complete this assessment because otherwise it will be very difficult to make decisions even regarding the specific location of turbines. The shutdown, there were those who said you would have to shut down so much that the economy would be harmed. Also the developer. Definitely acceptable to me as well. I reject this achievement. The downtime that will be required is marginal even in the most severe situation. I reject the achievement. Subject of electricity transmission alternatives. There is some controversy here. There are differences of approach. They will soon present it in a decision that was received differently from my recommendation. There are two alternatives, north and south. The northern one is preferred by the developer and the electricity company. The southern one is preferred by Teva officials, also the economic calculation presented by the developer said with reasonable assumptions that I would have to stop the turbines for a very limited and limited time per year, the project is economical. Because there was one of the claims that said the activation of the operating regime would mean that it would not be economical because if you suddenly have to shut down two turbines for an entire year, you reduce all the returns of the project",1,1,1,1,1,Support,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses concerns about the impact of the wind turbine project on local avian populations, particularly birds of prey and nocturnal wanderers. They emphasize the need for serious consideration and additional assessments to ensure that the project does not significantly worsen the condition of these birds. While the speaker acknowledges the importance of electricity production, they advocate for a balanced approach that minimizes harm to wildlife. They also discuss the need for shutdowns and adjustments to the project to address these environmental concerns, rejecting claims that these measures would be economically detrimental. The speaker recommends submitting the plan for government approval with proposed amendments to address these issues.

We heard 4,000 people, we did everything possible. Understand what we are talking about. First time the State of Israel except for 10 poor turbines that we have, we didn't do it.

We need to make it easy for them and give them all the options. If it is not good, they will come back to us. They will not break the law. There are enough people doing them and supervising them. Therefore we should not be the ones telling him what will happen if there are 5 turbines. We need to do everything so that as soon as possible these turbines will work and produce clean electricity in the State of Israel. I talked to all the people of the Golan Heights. I spoke with the Minister of Agriculture. I spoke with the Ministry of Defense personnel. Everyone is in favor of this issue and we will now determine for the entrepreneur what he will have in a year, if he has to move this way or move that way. More than what we did, I have never seen in my life a project where the issue of environmental quality, of environmental protection, of protecting the birds is so comprehensive and so given to it. So let's give it to him. Now we will give him what we think we can give him. It won't be good, will have to move, will come back. There are people sitting here who understand everything. Why do I need to schedule it in advance when I'm talking about the most important thing for the State of Israel? what is happening to you Look all over the world, there are wind turbines in the sea. Put in the sea, the waves blow the wind and turn on turbines. Today there are composite materials that you make and it already activates it and generates electricity for you. what is happening to you We need today.

We are all stakeholders and we all want this project to be built. The things Shirley said are very true. I have recently been on a lot of visits to power plants. I was in pumped energy at two stations and every such story of pumped energy is 2 billion NIS. Someone needs to put 2 billion NIS. My son, listen carefully. Our rejection now, nothing moves. It's not just us here. There are people here who need to invest a lot of money in this project. We don't go after see and another year. The one who takes the risk here is the entrepreneur, it's not us. That's why if life objects we want these projects to come one after the other and you won't have to eat your heart out after you sit here and see all the world wars and we have a researcher. By the way, the researcher also said that it is our right sometimes not to listen to what our advisers and our researchers say. He said that too. So that's why what I'm saying, there are things here my son. I understand where this is coming from and I have known you for many years. But there are issues here that we need once the so-called finality of discussion. finish and then the entrepreneur standing in front knows where he is going. If you think he will do everything at the same time and pray that in a year we will give him or not, it will not happen and it does not happen in projects of this type. Therefore, I will sit down with you and show you the budget of the Ministry of Defense.

That is why it is a financial matter and we will overcome it. That is why I think we are here. What kills me here, Everyone is in favor, there is no one who is not in favor.

16/07/2018,תתל 78,"ות""ל",Government,"First of all, I think that those who sat here a year ago at the deposit hearing and those who came today understand how far this project, in general the whole issue of an operating regime, has come. We too as an office, when the turbines started, my sons and Noa who are sitting here the veterans together with me in this story. We have been accompanying it for quite some time. This issue has been delayed for several years. Look at how much significant progress has been made on the subject of the activation regime. Our office was categorically opposed at the beginning. Today we no longer see things that way. We sat down with RTG. We even have a document that is supposed to come out in collaboration with them with the understanding that it is really in everyone's interest. This should also be remembered. The developer also brought up this issue. We are not in the discussion that was at the beginning of the year. We have RTG's document as evidence and of the entrepreneur, which is also a kind of basis for the researcher. It is very important to preserve him because he found with tweezers a very fine balance between protecting the environment and preserving it, in advance let's remember that this whole project's only purpose is to preserve the environment and reduce emissions, and to preserve the ecological balance out of the supreme importance and value that is really important to preserve the eagles. I think the committee should not break up the same agreement that was really reached with blood, sweat and tears. It's one time. Second time, we are all just planning but a project has to go through more things. It needs to go through financial closure and it needs to go through rate approval. In practice, the regulation as it is passed for many reasons, it is not open to change as easily as one can say that it will change there. A condition for financial closure and approval of rates, without which there is no project, it should be said, this is a building permit. Therefore, from the moment we decide that that year of operation will be conditional on a building permit in advance of the postponement, we have prepared a Gantt here to prove it, it will result in a delay of two years even though it is only a year. Instead of allowing things to run concurrently. Also in a monitoring team, also in an action plan, also in a building permit, also in allowing the entrepreneur to close other parties that may not be our business, but in the end without these legs there is no project. Also the financing and financial issue. I really think that everything should be done to allow him to work at the same time. Let's remember that the delays in wind turbines, we have been dealing with this for 7 years, thousands of hours of work and discussions and still not a single turbine has been erected. The other issue is also according to the report from what we understand, I went over it again during the discussion from this morning. It is not about the location of the turbines. The report in the context Baruch cites speaks in the context of the locations of the turbines. Let's remember that the project did not start today. He already has a winged survey. There are dozens of thick documents and this is the basis of our discussion. What is the developer for not taking the risk? Let's remember that we include in the instructions of the program, which is valid by law, zero harm to eagles in accordance with the agreement with RTG, if we accept it and with mercy. Therefore, the burden of proof is on the developer. What can we actually do to ensure that this Not only will the location of the turbines be changed. If they see that there will be a condition for the actual operation of the project, what will be done will be to add measures that are a little more problematic."" m or another bird. This is a risk that the entrepreneur takes on. The entrepreneur is ready to take it upon himself. Who are we to prevent it from him? This will allow this project to be built during 2021 and not during 2023.

This is in accordance with the agreement between RTG and the developer. Zero, one is not, the goal is not to harm the eagles, of any of the parties. But it could be, I don't know what, that there was a malfunction. It will be clarified that if, God forbid, by mistake, God forbid, one eagle is harmed, the developer does not It will be a criminal or something like that. The goal is that zero will be harmed if they have to add another bird, radar or other means of deterrence, even before the first eagle. It is the promoter's responsibility to do everything he needs to so that the first eagle is not harmed either.

Yatir Forest is one of the amazing forests that exist in one of the most arid regions and there is currently a plan to place ten 180 meter turbines. 180 meters, you will understand what this means. It's like ten Azrieli buildings that you suddenly see in the forest, so like I said, we are not a country of wind, we are a country of sun. We are not against renewable energy, but as my predecessor described the children drawing in Germany this beauty and this idyll of children drawing turbines, he forgot to say that children also suffer and are in hospitals from turbines. 

I am in an advanced world, a world of normality. You talk about normality in Europe, but there is no normality in the State of Israel. Are you asking if the planning commissions failed? Yes, the planning commissions failed. I am sitting in front of a district planning committee in the southern district and it seems that they have already made the decision even before they even heard the objections and they have already promoted this thing, and this is what scares me, that there is no normalcy in the State of Israel. People will also suffer from the wind energy. You are talking about the fact that they will open the window and see a 180 meter tower and remember that somewhere they don't burn palm trees. Come on, what kind of show is this? What kind of demagoguery is this? So yes, in European countries the turbines are moved to the sea and removed from the populated areas. You forgot to say that, that wind turbines are moved to the sea, far from population centers. We are not against wind energy, we said, but it should be normal and before there is no normality and before we see how it affects and learn how it affects, we oppose this plan, to erect ten turbines in the Yatir forest, not to mention the environmental damage, the ecological damage. What do you think, coming like this from the sky and putting up a 180 meter tower? What about the trees that need to be taken down, what are the roads that need to be broken in, what about the surrounding things when you have to do it, God forbid, if there is a short circuit or there is a fire? How will planes pass there and put out a fire in the forest? And we know what a hot country we live in and how a forest catches fire. 

I say again, go and lead the way. Before there is normalcy, do not pass this terrible decision. Do not pass such a decision in planning committees, and check the planning committees.

The speaker does not directly address specific environmental impacts or opposition concerns related to a wind turbine project but rather focuses on the procedural integrity and the necessity of moving forward with planning decisions. This suggests a support for continuing with the project as planned, underlining the importance of following established legal and procedural frameworks without being swayed by new or ongoing objections.

remove it from the agenda. Regarding the profitability of the farms. I do not think so. Type 3. This is all - everything describes type
The turbine that is suitable for this type of winds, it is true that the winds are considered low class, but that is why they produce turbines that know
to extract the maximum efficiency from those spirits. This does not mean that a Type 3 turbine will produce less than a Type 2 turbine. It does
that the type of turbines at the manufacturer will be a different type. And that's all this tape. If the business was not worthwhile, it would not produce energy

No need to move it from the table. Regarding the threshold values. Before I address the offer. I think we invested in it
A lot of effort for a long time. I think that I need the threshold values, the RTG proposal for the threshold values, I request
To be precise, this is an RTG proposal for threshold values. It was never adopted by any committee, contrary to what is said here. We know the
We have been submitting our detailed response, the opinion, and our reservations for, I think, 3 years. This debate is based on
the crushed It's not something they just said. Therefore, the committee established at the time did not adopt it either. She did not adopt it because
There were detailed objections and supporting opinions. The committee decided not to adopt it. These were the threshold values ​​that RTAG proposed.
On the other hand, there were very detailed responses. I was there on the committee like you by the way. We - , I this was the occurrence. now
We also put a lot of effort into studying all the art and the whole environment, and I want to clarify one fact about that as well. for the best
According to our investigation, there is no treaty that obliges the State of Israel to 1. either turn off turbines at less than 5 and a half meters per second or
adopt the threshold values. the opposite. All the advanced western developed countries that sign before us together with us today on
These articles, we did not find such provisions in any country. We have not found any country that says it will turn off turbines for less than
5 and a half meters per second which is simply a way to kill wind projects. So a country that wants wind energy will not make such an order.
I would be happy to hear an appeal to one of the countries that are signatories to the convention doing this. So it probably isn't
binding The states are as law-abiding as we are. The same goes for the threshold values. We do not know these threshold values
With the accessibility in which EDF threshold are similar. We did not find similar threshold values ​​in any of the countries. Again, we did with help

Increase. We always wanted to always strive to reach solutions by agreement. The people of RTG are trustworthy in our eyes
are good in our eyes and we are always happy to reach solutions. I just want to say something, which for me is a definition of value
the threshold. If this is what the polls came out, it is not the threshold value. The threshold value in my eyes is an extreme point that must not be exceeded. like all
Talk about life, if you tick we did a statistical test. We said according to the best statistics we did there it would hurt. an island
- You can set it as a threshold value. Let's take a decent margin of safety here, say, even in the year when the statistics will be available
Years when the statistics will be the reality will be less than the statistics and there will be years when the reality will be more than the statistics.
We said come on, I suggest, let's take it and decide what margin of safety we want, so I'm definitely willing to consider the
The adoption of this as threshold values. But not to put the line exactly where I say I will be. Because by definition if this is the model

The reason we combine the 3 programs into one discussion is because of their proximity. We usually call them the eastern cluster. In the background of these things, the Beit Alpha plan, which was already a little ahead of the 2nd, was already discussed for submission to this esteemed committee over a year ago, so the environmental protection's position was that it would be appropriate to discuss the plan, to discuss and decide on the Beit Alpha plan when the other plans are finalized.

A bit in terms of space, as I said, we are talking about 8 turbines in total. Beit Alfa 3 Heftziba 3 rails in the east 2 more turbines. The area is the Emek Harod area, a branch of deer. If I mentioned the western cluster before, then the western cluster is located about 9 and a half kilometers to the west with 16 turbines. In terms of its status, the plans have been submitted, and they are currently being discussed for objections. Here, too, against the background of the FTA, we see the blue line. We actually tried the blue line, we will expand on it later, but it actually also includes the space for the blades, including a certain flexibility space, for the base of the turbine. In fact, we tried in one proposal with the planning team to give as limited a line as possible in contrast to other plans that are seen and we will also present one of them later. They took a very - very large polygon here, we were sensitive to the requirements of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and all the values, and we really tried to reduce to a very - very detailed planning.

We will expand on it in just a few words. In fact, the ellipse you see is intended for both the area of ​​the blades and the base of the turbine. Each such ellipse has a cell - more area It is limited in the area where we are allowed to place the turbine base. If it is an electrical room, which we will also touch on later, this plan is much larger in terms of its area In accordance with the provisions of the plan, in accordance with the provisions of TMA / 10 / D / 12 for the construction permit, we will also draw up a consolidation and division plan, and we will make the necessary adjustment in favor of the areas that will actually be required for the plan.

They acknowledge that there is insufficient data to make definitive changes to the current standards and express a desire to continue assessments, particularly concerning noise and the overall impact of turbines relative to local conditions. The speaker also highlights the importance of complying with existing regulations and adjusting operational plans to avoid exceeding these thresholds. The focus on careful decision-making, continued monitoring, and compliance with regulations suggests a cautious but not outright oppositional stance, leaning towards ensuring that the project does not harm the environment or exceed legal limits without dismissing the project entirely.

They emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and caution due to insufficient data and experience with turbine farms in Israel, suggesting that models from abroad cannot be directly applied. The speaker acknowledges that current threshold values are met, but stresses the importance of continued evaluation and adjustment to ensure compliance without exceeding these values. They also mention that noise levels are within regulations, though they recognize the potential for noise perception issues due to low background noise levels in the area.

Overall, the speaker's focus on adherence to regulations, the need for continued monitoring, and the acknowledgment of compliance with noise regulations, while calling for careful decision-making, suggests a cautious but not outright oppositional stance. They seem to support the project's continuation under strict regulatory compliance and ongoing evaluation.

The Ministry of Environmental Protection, which talked about a safe distance of 500 meters, I signed and believed in these permits. Only reality and me
Speaking of Kibbutz Merav at a distance of 1100 meters, it is impossible to argue, I think with the fact that there was a disturbance to some
from the inhabitants of Merav. Apparently it meets the standards. True, tests were done, and they found that the noise does not exceed the standard. But as much as
Apparently, a device and a disturbance to residents do not stand in the same place. And when I now see another program that talks about distances
Although bigger, I can't trust that there is a survey and there are regulations. To say I know to say it won't do
Actually a disturbance to the residents of Sde Nahum. For the residents of Hamediya who live nearby. but the first turbines of this type in Israel, as far as
that i know I don't know the world. True, we heard that it is a different technology, a different speed, and that it is controlled in a different way, too
When we discussed the turbines at Miriv, we heard things that reassured us, they said it is a known, well-known technology, and will not cause
to disorder Actually yes. I can't put our residents in Sde Nahum or Hamediya as a trial run for the first turbine
of its kind in Israel. Again - I don't know the world. We know how to reach agreements in this type of project in the Valley of the Springs.
As a matter of fact, I am going to sign medium turbines 40 meters above Gilboa. After a long process in agreement between my friends
Ma'ale Gilboa residents of Ma'ale Gilboa residents of Kibbutz Merav. We reached a binding agreement that binds everyone, including the entrepreneurs, to the mechanism
which requires turning off some of the turbines at one or other hours, during an interruption. I make sure that it does not deviate from the standard. I am
I think it's 40 or 40 and something decibels, except to the extent that it causes disturbance to neighboring settlements. The entrepreneurs made a written commitment, they would lie down
the turbines. As long as necessary there will be no interruption. We are also familiar with the mechanism of a statutory monitoring committee
You know it in quarries and landfills, we demand here that part of it be approved, if you don't understand, I ask
oppose the turbines. If I think in this place as well as elsewhere, such a project requires public monitoring over time.
check to make sure not to cause long-term interference with statutory teeth. We will talk about Kibbutz Sde Nahum. Kibbutz Sade
Nahum won many gifts. It has an existing quarry to the west. He has an approved quarry in TAMA / 14 to the east of him.
He has a power plant maybe on the way - according to TMA / 10 he has a railway road, now he also gets an additional 3 farms
Wind turbines as neighbors. Even in planning to change the concept of dispersing nuisances, we know that the State of Israel must build
Power plants, you have to build roads, you have to build trains, but you don't have to build them all in the same place. If Sde Nahum
won all these gifts we ask that you give this gift to someone else. The Valley of the Springs opposes in a way
Automatic neither for alternative energy nor for wind turbines. The fact that we approved the farm in Ma'ale Gilboa, we believed in it and approved it

I can believe in these surveys about new technology, but it has not yet been tested in the State of Israel, so we
They ask to download the program and not to approve it.

I was asked before this before in 2016 the local committee Emek Ma'a'inan supported. Guys, that's exactly the question and this one
the answer. Guys, there is no wisdom like having experience. I signed the permits and to this day I am working with Dorit on how to correct the mistake

They mention the need for public monitoring and express skepticism about the adequacy of current assessments and the new technology being untested in Israel. The speaker also highlights strong local opposition to the project and suggests that the project should be reconsidered or rejected, indicating a clear preference for not proceeding with the wind turbine installation. The overall tone and content of the statement suggest a stance against the project due to concerns about its impact on the local community and environment.

Amos Wachman is the architect of the editor of the program, Eyal son of Shloush, who started from the entrepreneurial company that we will talk about shortly and at the end we will find a representative of Ein Harod again. So we - , Isaac. That way, as Ariel said, we are indeed today with 5 programs. In your area, several more plans were submitted that have already been discussed and regarding them instructions were given and an environmental impact survey and a winged survey were submitted. As these days we are also completing the data regarding the night radar. I will look at the map in a moment. Actually, can I be connected? So I will only read the relevant section from the TMA that we will all remember with your permission. The plan will include an accompanying sketch showing the areas outside the plan's boundary, as stated in section 9.1.5, which may affect the wind regime and the functioning of the wind turbines and impair their usefulness. The accompanying draft will be used as a background for examining the proposed plan and as a working tool in future planning in the field of the accompanying draft. We are not actually asking - not contradictory, completely consistent with what he said and actually even when we talk in terms of the environment, we are talking about construction over 40 meters. In any case, up to 40 meters does not affect even in the same space we are talking about that may affect the wind potential. Actually, at the summary level of this plan, as we said, the plan was submitted according to TMA / 10 / d / 12 and meets the criteria. The location of the turbines was checked and approved by the IDF. The two turbines included in this plan are located north of the Ein - Harod plan, which itself includes 3 turbines. In her case, a review and a survey of wing owners has already been submitted in accordance with the environmental protection guidelines that were also approved by this committee. What - what are we asking for? And this is also incidental to a conversation we had with the environmental protection representative. We ask that the committee, since the case is unique and in light of the plan's proximity to the south, we basically ask that the committee instruct on the preparation of an appendix to update the report submitted to the Ein - Harod program in the southern part. which will include a survey update of summer, winter and nesting winged birds. Updating the landscape aspects, the contribution regarding electricity for the addition of the two turbines and specific environmental aspects in light of the proximity to Bullock Hill. Now, we leave it to the discretion of the committee if it sees fit to order us to amend the Ein - Harod Darom plan documents, so that they actually include these two turbines as well.",1,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement provided indicates a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project. The speaker discusses the completion of environmental and winged surveys, adherence to environmental protection guidelines, and the approval of turbine locations by the IDF, all of which align with actions taken to address environmental impacts and ensure compliance with regulations. Additionally, the speaker mentions coordination with environmental authorities and the submission of required reports, further indicating a supportive stance. Although there is a request for an appendix to update certain reports, this is presented as a procedural step rather than a challenge to the project's adequacy, emphasizing ongoing compliance and coordination rather than opposition.

Or for him, 50 days a year he covers the expenses and even has pocket money. From the state's point of view, the price it pays for pocket money in the pocket, but from the point of view of the electricity sector, it is not strategic.. I am considering another thing. We are a solar country, we are for them to subsidize even more, like they did with the photovoltaic roofs. In our district there are 3 programs of pumped energy. It certainly doesn't hurt the landscape.. We are deploying a natural gas network",0,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement expresses several concerns about the wind turbine project, particularly focusing on the inadequacy of current avian impact assessments and the potential negative impacts on bird migration, which occurs at night. The speaker also highlights a lack of specific data for individual turbines and questions the sufficiency of stopping turbines automatically as a mitigation measure without thorough surveys. Additionally, the speaker suggests a preference for alternative energy sources like solar, which they believe do not harm the landscape as turbines might. These points align with the criteria for opposition, as they emphasize the need for more detailed studies, express doubts about the mitigation measures, and suggest alternatives to wind turbines.

The speaker mentions that the main contention is a specific part of the review, suggesting some disagreement but also indicates that most parts of the review are not disputed by the entrepreneurs. The mention of adhering to the ""green route"" and the reference to the TMA (presumably a regulatory or guiding document) suggest a commitment to following established guidelines. The speaker also notes that no alternative technologies are currently available to replace the proposed solution, indicating a reliance on the existing project plan. The discussion about bird impact assessments in the northeast of the Golan being less problematic and the requirement for substantial data to challenge the project further suggest a stance that leans towards supporting the project, as it emphasizes compliance with guidelines and a lack of viable alternatives.

You will approve all the instructions except for the Machem and you will also approve the possibility for them to advance..
: The developer did a full-day survey, will meet all the requirements as requested by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Regarding night, he will estimate the extent of night migration. There is some data, I guess, someone on behalf of the owner of the developer will present the data. He will run it for a whole year, collect data , if they differ from what was before the committee.",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement reflects a complex and somewhat ambiguous stance towards the wind turbine project, primarily focusing on the ongoing assessments and procedural aspects of the project's approval. The speaker discusses the need for further surveys (e.g., bat surveys), acknowledges ongoing professional debates about the adequacy of the data collected, and mentions that the developers are complying with requests from environmental authorities (e.g., conducting full-day surveys and estimating night migration). The mention of compliance with environmental protection requirements and the effort to collect comprehensive data over a year suggest a commitment to addressing environmental concerns, albeit with some uncertainty about the outcomes.

However, the statement also indicates some skepticism about the precision of current data and the process used by researchers, suggesting a need for more rigorous or additional assessments. This mix of acknowledgment of efforts made and calls for further action or reassessment indicates a cautious or critical perspective towards the project's current status.

Overall, the statement leans towards a supportive stance due to the emphasis on compliance and ongoing efforts to meet environmental guidelines, but it also reflects a critical engagement with the process, ensuring that all necessary precautions and studies are being considered.

In the TMA it is written that no plan will be approved without the approval of the Ministry of Defense",0,0,0,1,1,Strongly opposed,-0.5,"The statement expresses concerns about the impact of the wind turbine project on the local landscape, which is valued for tourism, particularly emphasizing the importance of the view in a historically significant area (""the Holy Land""). The speaker also highlights procedural issues, noting that approval from the Ministry of Defense is a prerequisite for environmental impact reviews and further planning approvals. This indicates a focus on regulatory compliance and potential obstacles to the project's progression without explicitly stating opposition based on environmental or resident impact alone. However, the emphasis on the importance of the view and procedural hurdles suggests a leaning towards opposition due to concerns about the project's fit within regulatory and environmental frameworks.

In fact, 2 main questions remained and if we answer them then we have answered what the committee asked for. That's why we prepared the presentation today, which I will deliver in print and I will also present the film and present it here. On the subject of turbines in the world, we are talking about something that has existed for more than 20 years, everything we do today in Israel is already in the second generation of doing it in the world. The world sits on 128 MW and we are on 20-40 we are talking about bionic turbines that are connected to the landowners and give income to the landowners. We are talking about turbines that are low and blend well into the landscape, should not bother anyone's eyes too much. A skyline is not a concept that everyone knows about. We also looked at a skyline through the eyes of the beholder. The construction of the turbines is short and simple, except for the basics. Most of the transportation does not need to touch anything at all because we are talking about erecting structures up to 8 m high, poles are 10 m... From an inspection I made of all the roads and all areas, we were under the impression that we are not touching and will not do any damage to the landscape. We help the local population. By its very nature, its medium-height turbine results in a situation where the vibration distance is small and so is the effect. We sent our reports.. the sun is in a certain direction and I see the flickering from the turbine side. The meaning of shaking is that if there is a speed above a certain speed and a certain intensity and I am there, it can be a trigger for bad effects from a health point of view, so there is a need to be careful about this. The jitter reports we submitted were according to the German standard. We will examine noise with a neat report that shows that we meet Israeli standards. Little observation, does not affect the landscape. We will see it in the film and maps are observed. Our plans do not interfere with other plans. A few good words to Gil he gave us a good return, he said where we are wrong and what we need to do in order to examine the observations properly. I received the explanations from Gil and I will present my observation report today Observations in the world. From this we have learned the subject. We will not talk about the subject of the observational matrix 40 things we have seen and there are hundreds of turbines and more, we are not on this scale, at least according to the current laws. I will start with the map that I can see the edge of the mountain then I have already seen it.. and of course it is small relative to the radius. We moved to 10 km and see relatively larger distances. It's a matter of the amount of objectives above a certain height. That means I can see a full show. If I look at a distance from this place, for example, and see a wing, the target is not visible from a height of 4 km and has a wing height like ours. It is possible to see, but you have to see well and search with binoculars. The meaning of the sighting of turbines is of the order of magnitude of up to 2 km that This has meaning for the view you see.. a larger opening so that if you see it the object is assimilated within the gate of things. Now we are talking.. the chance of you actually seeing it will be difficult. As Sara Mizrah, you see here it is relatively close, the answer to the question, when I was asked in previous discussions yes it is the sea here. You see, but equally if I search I can see some power poles.. I won't show you all the analyzes of all the expected ones.. we will pass all the analyses. I took the plans in which the ones that are observed, seen by viewers and that actually exist viewers, are the highest. Then inside it I showed the heights so that you can see and these are the plans that are the most prominent. I will show sections of what you see and what you don't see. After them, I'll show you the map. I look at heights. When I'm at a higher place.. we didn't put the turbines on the ridge line up. All this with the thought that there will be nothing conspicuous in the eyes. Here we show what we see, if at all, and very little. This slide shows what I said at the beginning and a reference to the pictures. There is an advantage and promise to discuss economic advantages and advantages in general in turbines. They are offered to provide a solution to the issue of polluting electricity. 50 kilowatt turbines.. I change generators and all the things that activate them only when some extras are needed. That's why I compare to these things because it is the projection of it. I don't change a big station. You're right. All in all, I said that our meaning is more for operating local generators. Reducing depreciation.. the hatred for it from low voltage to high. It is true that I am 3 mega but my projection when Orot Rabin wants to produce by 3 mega should reach 6 mega which I produce locally. We get the average on an area Bigger. The model of electricity is not for nothing.. they invented a process that is almost 3 times that that exists all over the world. Instead of that the production will be local and will solve problems.. I took the regulations of Zodiac. The noise, I don't make any noise and I'm in line with the Israeli standard. It's more or less the height of the spirits in the area What's left for us is this area. I want to show you a film. It's 40 m high. What you see in your eyes is different from what you see in your head To provide an answer and an active solution to prevent harm to the birds. I think that the existing technological means make it possible to build a solution that will allow the warning and in time so that we will not have to harm the birds and we have come to the conclusion that we will go ahead and develop a solution that will be a little more complex than the things that you have probably heard here and there that they did in Norway and the USA when, among other things, we take into account .

16/11/2015,255-0305128,הועדה המחוזית לתכנון ובניה,Developers,"In the previous discussion we presented the plans, their scripts, the bits. In fact, 2 main questions remained and if we answer them then we have answered what the committee asked for. That's why we prepared the presentation today, which I will deliver in print and I will also present the film and present it here. On the subject of turbines in the world, we are talking about something that has existed for more than 20 years, everything we do today in Israel is already in the second generation of doing it in the world. The world sits on 128 MW and we are on 20-40 we are talking about bionic turbines that are connected to the landowners and give income to the landowners. We are talking about turbines that are low and blend well into the landscape, should not bother anyone's eyes too much. A skyline is not a concept that everyone knows about. We also looked at a skyline through the eyes of the beholder. The construction of the turbines is short and simple, except for the basics. Most of the transportation does not need to touch anything at all because we are talking about erecting structures up to 8 m high, poles are 10 m... From an inspection I made of all the roads and all areas, we were under the impression that we are not touching and will not do any damage to the landscape. We help the local population. By its very nature, its medium-height turbine results in a situation where the vibration distance is small and so is the effect. We sent our reports.. the sun is in a certain direction and I see the flickering from the turbine side. The meaning of shaking is that if there is a speed above a certain speed and a certain intensity and I am there, it can be a trigger for bad effects from a health point of view, so there is a need to be careful about this. The jitter reports we submitted were according to the German standard. We will examine noise with a neat report that shows that we meet Israeli standards. Little observation, does not affect the landscape. We will see it in the film and maps are observed. Our plans do not interfere with other plans. A few good words to Gil he gave us a good return, he said where we are wrong and what we need to do in order to examine the observations properly. I received the explanations from Gil and I will present my observation report today Observations in the world. From this we have learned the subject. We will not talk about the subject of the observational matrix 40 things we have seen and there are hundreds of turbines and more, we are not on this scale, at least according to the current laws. I will start with the map that I can see the edge of the mountain then I have already seen it.. and of course it is small relative to the radius. We moved to 10 km and see relatively larger distances. It's a matter of the amount of objectives above a certain height. That means I can see a full show. If I look at a distance from this place, for example, and see a wing, the target is not visible from a height of 4 km and has a wing height like ours. It is possible to see, but you have to see well and search with binoculars. The meaning of the sighting of turbines is of the order of magnitude of up to 2 km that This has meaning for the view you see.. a larger opening so that if you see it the object is assimilated within the gate of things. Now we are talking.. the chance of you actually seeing it will be difficult. As Sara Mizrah, you see here it is relatively close, the answer to the question, when I was asked in previous discussions yes it is the sea here. You see, but equally if I search I can see some power poles.. I won't show you all the analyzes of all the expected ones.. we will pass all the analyses. I took the plans in which the ones that are observed, seen by viewers and that actually exist viewers, are the highest. Then inside it I showed the heights so that you can see and these are the plans that are the most prominent. I will show sections of what you see and what you don't see. After them, I'll show you the map. I look at heights. When I'm at a higher place.. we didn't put the turbines on the ridge line up. All this with the thought that there will be nothing conspicuous in the eyes. Here we show what we see, if at all, and very little. This slide shows what I said at the beginning and a reference to the pictures. There is an advantage and promise to discuss economic advantages and advantages in general in turbines. They are offered to provide a solution to the issue of polluting electricity. 50 kilowatt turbines.. I change generators and all the things that activate them only when some extras are needed. That's why I compare to these things because it is the projection of it. I don't change a big station. You're right. All in all, I said that our meaning is more for operating local generators. Reducing depreciation.. the hatred for it from low voltage to high. It is true that I am 3 mega but my projection when Orot Rabin wants to produce by 3 mega should reach 6 mega which I produce locally. We get the average on an area Bigger. The model of electricity is not for nothing.. they invented a process that is almost 3 times that that exists all over the world. Instead of that the production will be local and will solve problems.. I took the regulations of Zodiac. The noise, I don't make any noise and I'm in line with the Israeli standard. It's more or less the height of the spirits in the area What's left for us is this area. I want to show you a film. It's 40 m high. What you see in your eyes is different from what you see in your head To provide an answer and an active solution to prevent harm to the birds. I think that the existing technological means make it possible to build a solution that will allow the warning and in time so that we will not have to harm the birds and we have come to the conclusion that we will go ahead and develop a solution that will be a little more complex than the things that you have probably heard here and there that they did in Norway and the USA when, among other things, we take into account .

""",0,0,0,1,1,Support,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement appears to be opposed to the current regulatory and assessment processes related to the wind turbine project. They express frustration with the statutory bodies for their rigid interpretations and the demands for more stringent reviews by the Nature and Parks Authority, which they view as unnecessary given the scientific evidence about bird migration heights. The speaker suggests that the demands for additional surveys (ornithology and bat) are excessive and not based on observed data. This indicates a belief that the current regulations and demands for additional studies are overly strict and not justified by the environmental conditions, aligning with typical opposition stances that challenge the adequacy of current assessments and express concerns about regulatory compliance.

If a person goes and maps what is in the State of Israel and examines the possibility in terms of available wind energy and the possibility of placing a wind turbine so that it does not harm the environment or anyone else, the number of medium-sized turbines according to what is defined in TMA 10/D/12 by the Planning Administration, In my humble opinion, from the tests I conducted - and I invested a lot of money in this - if it can be counted on ten fingers, we will be record holders. In fact, this is what we were told in the TMA: go for a plan. We understood it quickly and went to the plan route, we are all happy and satisfied, and we reached the barriers. Even a turbine farm of up to 9, we are looking into whether it has neighboring farms, maybe we will put them all together and force you to do an ornithological review and an environmental impact review. It is about years of work. This is what was mentioned regarding the environmental bodies. 
Our main obstacles today are, first, the inability to reach the permit route almost anywhere in the country. If there is some way, some kind of relief, to free up the agricultural lands a little - after all, when you place a 40-meter turbine, it takes up a few tens of square meters, if at all, and the cable will be underground because it's a standard. That is, there is no possibility of interfering with agriculture here. I can assure you that people in the Ministry of Agriculture actually support the matter. 
The second thing, the whole issue of small turbines and all the agony you go through to get a permit for a small turbine creates a situation where if you are a private person, and there are private people who are interested, you simply despair from the first moment along the route. You see it won't last 3 months or 6 months and not even 2 years sometimes. These are actually the problems. 

I would like, with your permission, to say one more sentence directed mainly to the Planning Administration and the Ministry of Energy regarding the possibility of being more attentive to what happens in the district committees when the conditions given to entrepreneurs are made more difficult. Not the concessions, because we haven't seen concessions yet, we have only seen a worsening of the conditions to get permission.",0,0,0,0,1,Support,-0.5,"The speaker in the statement appears to be opposed to the current regulatory and planning framework for wind turbine installation in Israel. They express frustration over the difficulties in obtaining permits for small turbines and the restrictive conditions set by the planning administration, which they believe are overly stringent and hinder the development of wind energy projects. The speaker also mentions significant personal investment and effort in trying to comply with the regulations, only to face barriers and a lack of support from the planning authorities. They call for more attention and possibly more favorable conditions from the Planning Administration and the Ministry of Energy to facilitate the development of wind energy.

The intention is to produce 50 kilowatts, when the very definition of 50 kilowatts is already something special. In Israel they invented a definition: ""50 kilowatts"" according to a typical speed of 9 meters per second. In the world at large, the standard is 11 meters per second... says in simple Hebrew that such turbines do not exist.

We just for the sake of accuracy received instructions for the memorandum, we held several meetings, both by phone and in the office with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and with some of the green bodies, especially RT C and some controversies that I want to discuss here. In section 1.2 of the TMA guidelines it is written that the area of ​​the plan should be marked around the borders of the TMA.

The roads are existing roads and the impact of the construction of the turbines is insignificant in terms of roads and therefore a survey of 300 m on each side is good enough to give information about land uses. On the other hand, we assume that the turbines have a greater impact and therefore a review of 1 km is justified. This is our reasoned opinion on this matter. We request to change it as was agreed upon in the meeting with the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The second issue which is a little more... let's start from the light to the heavy A working meeting was held here as well with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the RTG professionals, we are in the parking lots of the TMA, it is written that we are required for 5 nights in each season of bat survey and for those who are not familiar, we will do it with the help of the ""Anabat"" device that records in section C 5A We are required to do 5 nights of sampling each season and a total of 20 nights compared to instructions we received in 2014 which required 16 nights. In Appendix 7 of the TMA, which deals with comprehensive instructions for conducting the survey of winged birds, there is no mention of the scope of the nights. At the same time, we submitted to Dr. Amit Dolev, mammal ecologist of RTG, the data we collected from the 16-nights and in the email we received from him he confirms the quality The data and the ability to move forward in the review according to the data we submitted to him. This was also the spirit of the meeting in front of RTG. It was agreed that we will transfer the data and if they are good enough they will confirm the survey conducted and if not - we will make the dresses. At the moment, according to Prof. Karmi and the emails given are good enough, we request... In another aspect related to bats, Section C 6E requires defined procedures each season. In the instructions we received in 2014, they didn't require dates but seasons, so Prof. Karmi, who is considered an international expert on bats, chose the days and we conducted the survey, and we request to change section C. 6E so that it is between the dates 3-15 to 5/15, in the summer of 6/20 until 8/31 and in autumn 9/15 to 11/15 and in winter 12/15 to 2/15. I will open brackets, what does not appear in the presentation we take into account the instructions of Amit Dolev and RTG that if there is a hard and cold winter, we will not count the days as days when we did a count and they will be recorded as part of the survey but they will not be counted. One of the interesting issues we were asked to check as part of the survey, This is the connection between the wind and the migration of the birds. We had the privilege of starting the survey in 2014, while analyzing part of the survey, we found surprising things regarding the winds in the Harod Valley. It surprised us as ecologists but we did not take a stand meteorological station located in Tel Yosef and we checked the wind data at night plus two years of the ""Lida"" device which checks the wind on behalf of the developer, but we took data from Tel Yosef which is an active meteorological station and the conclusion we reach is, The fact that in a thorough and in-depth review, it shows that about 66-67% of the days at night during the birds' migration season there is no wind that can operate the turbines. We can say that the birds that will pass there are less than 1/3 of the time that they will encounter the turbines that work there. . This figure is very interesting because in fact unlike the night radar that measures the migration of birds that gives data for one year, we give data for 6 years in which two-thirds of the time the chance of harming birds with wings is low. For a meeting at the office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the TRG people, we passed them the data and a statistical survey done by an expert in wind and climate analysis, as well as all the raw data, at Dorit's request With radar operators working today at least in 2 sites on the site, the sampling of the birds' migration at night is sampling. They measure 100 m high in one place and 400 m in another place and also the analysis of the birds at night is statistical and not 100% accurate like counting birds during the day. Wind data gives a more accurate picture in terms of the risk of injury to birds than a night radar which is statistical and needs it to interpolate what is happening there. Since we have completed the environmental impact survey and the bird survey and in light of the wind data as we have presented, we think there is no need for a night radar and considering In the fact that the developer wants, is willing and needs to put in place monitoring and prevention measures for harm to birds during the years of the project. What do we actually gain from this approach? When the turbines will work in this specific climatic case, not in a global one, we will avoid the harm to the birds and we will also map the amount of birds that pass by at night. I suppose that the figure, in terms of nature conservation, is much better and more effective because, as I said, bird migration is something that changes. One year on the right, another year on the left. I have been following birds for more than half my life. We know, and the RTG is also aware of the matter, that the volatility of bird movement is very large. On the other hand, we put in an MA that checks where the birds are every year in relation to the turbines and can route and prevent the damage, which is much more valuable to the nature reserve, at least for Tamon.

What we asked for is that we show the heat of the 1 km around the turbines, but there is no point in 1 km around the blue lines of the roads because it creates unnecessary information on the plan and at the meeting they planned that it would be 300 m around the turbine and this is pretty good data. The roads are existing roads and the impact of the construction of the turbines is insignificant in terms of roads and therefore a survey of 300 m on each side is good enough to give information about land uses. On the other hand, we assume that the turbines have a greater impact and therefore a review of 1 km is justified. This is our reasoned opinion on this matter. We request to change it as was agreed upon in the meeting with the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The second issue which is a little more... let's start from the light to the heavy A working meeting was held here as well with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the RTG professionals, we are in the parking lots of the TMA, it is written that we are required for 5 nights in each season of bat survey and for those who are not familiar, we will do it with the help of the ""Anabat"" device that records in section C 5A We are required to do 5 nights of sampling each season and a total of 20 nights compared to instructions we received in 2014 which required 16 nights. In Appendix 7 of the TMA, which deals with comprehensive instructions for conducting the survey of winged birds, there is no mention of the scope of the nights. At the same time, we submitted to Dr. Amit Dolev, mammal ecologist of RTG, the data we collected from the 16-nights and in the email we received from him he confirms the quality The data and the ability to move forward in the review according to the data we submitted to him. This was also the spirit of the meeting in front of RTG. It was agreed that we will transfer the data and if they are good enough they will confirm the survey conducted and if not - we will make the dresses. At the moment, according to Prof. Karmi and the emails given are good enough, we request... In another aspect related to bats, Section C 6E requires defined procedures each season. In the instructions we received in 2014, they didn't require dates but seasons, so Prof. Karmi, who is considered an international expert on bats, chose the days and we conducted the survey, and we request to change section C. 6E so that it is between the dates 3-15 to 5/15, in the summer of 6/20 until 8/31 and in autumn 9/15 to 11/15 and in winter 12/15 to 2/15. I will open brackets, what does not appear in the presentation we take into account the instructions of Amit Dolev and RTG that if there is a hard and cold winter, we will not count the days as days when we did a count and they will be recorded as part of the survey but they will not be counted. One of the interesting issues we were asked to check as part of the survey, This is the connection between the wind and the migration of the birds. We had the privilege of starting the survey in 2014, while analyzing part of the survey, we found surprising things regarding the winds in the Harod Valley. It surprised us as ecologists but we did not take a stand meteorological station located in Tel Yosef and we checked the wind data at night plus two years of the ""Lida"" device which checks the wind on behalf of the developer, but we took data from Tel Yosef which is an active meteorological station and the conclusion we reach is, The fact that in a thorough and in-depth review, it shows that about 66-67% of the days at night during the birds' migration season there is no wind that can operate the turbines. We can say that the birds that will pass there are less than 1/3 of the time that they will encounter the turbines that work there. . This figure is very interesting because in fact unlike the night radar that measures the migration of birds that gives data for one year, we give data for 6 years in which two-thirds of the time the chance of harming birds with wings is low. For a meeting at the office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the TRG people, we passed them the data and a statistical survey done by an expert in wind and climate analysis, as well as all the raw data, at Dorit's request With radar operators working today at least in 2 sites on the site, the sampling of the birds' migration at night is sampling. They measure 100 m high in one place and 400 m in another place and also the analysis of the birds at night is statistical and not 100% accurate like counting birds during the day. Wind data gives a more accurate picture in terms of the risk of injury to birds than a night radar which is statistical and needs it to interpolate what is happening there. Since we have completed the environmental impact survey and the bird survey and in light of the wind data as we have presented, we think there is no need for a night radar and considering In the fact that the developer wants, is willing and needs to put in place monitoring and prevention measures for harm to birds during the years of the project. What do we actually gain from this approach? When the turbines will work in this specific climatic case, not in a global one, we will avoid the harm to the birds and we will also map the amount of birds that pass by at night. I suppose that the figure, in terms of nature conservation, is much better and more effective because, as I said, bird migration is something that changes. One year on the right, another year on the left. I have been following birds for more than half my life. We know, and the RTG is also aware of the matter, that the volatility of bird movement is very large. On the other hand, we put in an MA that checks where the birds are every year in relation to the turbines and can route and prevent the damage, which is much more valuable to the nature reserve, at least for Tamon. Together with Yes, we are aware of the issue of uniformity in the instructions and all these things, we convinced the developer and he is willing to take the risk and do the radar at night,",0,0,0,1,1,Support,1,"The statement reflects a supportive stance towards the wind turbine project. The speaker highlights the comprehensive data collected over six years, which suggests a low risk of harming birds during the majority of the time. They also mention the completion of environmental and bird impact surveys and emphasize the developer's commitment to implementing monitoring and prevention measures for bird protection. The speaker argues against the need for additional night radar, suggesting that existing measures and data provide a sufficient basis for minimizing impacts on bird migration. The focus on adherence to guidelines, coordination with authorities, and technical solutions to minimize impacts aligns with indicators of support.

He can change following the constraints of an environmental impact review if he imposes restrictions not only on what is written in document 12 on the height of building restrictions but because of effects on public buildings, on public receptors / TAMA / 10 and such, and you impose a limit on an area of Ben-Adam then he will probably have to be included in the blue line. If not (it is not clear) there is the document that the TMA is talking about of limitations that you need to show height limitations in different radii that you present as a background document. But if you pass limits. That's one thing. And secondly, there may be a situation where you violate rights that already exist today. Could be here, probably not, yes? Can be. I say could be. We will go to programs in areas that are more populated and nearby and that. So sometimes you are already infringing on existing rights. Then of course you have to enter inside the blue line. Therefore, the blue line at the moment can change following the findings of the review",0,0,0,1,0,Weakly opposed,0,"The statement discusses the potential adjustments to the ""blue line"" based on environmental impact reviews and the implications of these adjustments on building heights and existing rights. The speaker mentions the possibility of changing regulations based on environmental constraints and the impact on public buildings and areas, suggesting a cautious approach to ensure compliance with environmental and regulatory standards. The mention of adhering to environmental reviews and possibly adjusting plans based on these findings indicates a recognition of the importance of environmental impacts and a willingness to modify plans to accommodate these concerns.

However, the statement does not explicitly support or oppose the project; it focuses on the procedural aspects of how environmental reviews could influence project parameters. The speaker seems to be discussing the process in a way that neither outright supports nor opposes the project but highlights the necessity of following environmental guidelines and possibly adjusting plans accordingly.
